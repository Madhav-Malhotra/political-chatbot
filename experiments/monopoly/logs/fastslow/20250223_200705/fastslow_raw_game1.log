2025-02-23 20:07:09,684 - INFO - Fast reasoning: Buying 'the angel islington' for 100 provides an entry into the light blue color set, which can increase the overall rent collected if I manage to acquire all three properties in that color. With a base rent of 6, it's not high, but it has potential for substantial profit if houses or hotels are built. Given my current cash position, I can afford to buy it without jeopardizing my liquidity. Additionally, owning properties can help me avoid bankruptcy as I gather more assets for potential trading opportunities later. Overall, purchasing this property aligns with a strategy to maximize my chances of winning by building a property portfolio.

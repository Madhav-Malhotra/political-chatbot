Arguments: Reasoning: Buying Vine Street can be a strategically beneficial move. As an orange property, it has a relatively high return on investment, especially if I manage to build houses on it later. The base rent of 16 is not high, but once I own all three orange properties, the rent increases significantly, especially with the potential for building houses or a hotel.

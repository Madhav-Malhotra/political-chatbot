2025-02-23 20:06:35,558 - INFO - Fast reasoning: Buying the Electric Company can be a strategic move, especially since it is a utility property. Although it has no base rent, its rent is calculated based on the number of utilities owned. By purchasing it, you could increase your earning potential if you acquire the other utility (Water Works), as owning both would allow you to charge double rent. With your current cash of 1500, purchasing the Electric Company for 150 is a reasonable investment, given that it won't significantly impact your liquidity. Therefore, buying the Electric Company can enhance your chances of winning by diversifying your property portfolio and increasing potential rent income.

As an orange property, it has a relatively high rent value of 16, which can become significantly more lucrative with houses or a hotel built on it.

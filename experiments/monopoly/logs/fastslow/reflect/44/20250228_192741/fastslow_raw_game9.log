2025-02-28 19:34:07,039 - INFO - Fast input: 
    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of Monopoly.

    Rules of the game:
    1. Buying: Players can buy unowned properties they land on for the listed price. Mortgaging or trading properties owned properties is NOT allowed.
    2. Building: Rent at a property increases with houses or hotels built. Four houses can be upgraded to a hotel.
    3. Rent Bonus: Rent increases if a player owns all three properties of a color.
    4. Winning: The last player remaining after others go bankrupt wins.

    Your goal:
    Decide whether to buy a property in Monopoly. Maximize your chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.

    Past Related Decisions:

    Current Property Details:
    
    Property Name: electric company
    Type: utility
    Cost: 150
    Base Rent: None
    
        Number of Utilities Owned: 0
        

    Current Player Details:
    
    Cash: 1300
    Owned Roads: 0

    Finally, output a decimal percentage uncertainty between 0-1 to indicate your uncertainty in the decision.
    
2025-02-28 19:34:07,039 - INFO - Fast reasoning: Buying the Electric Company is a strategic move because utilities can provide significant rent returns, especially if both utilities are owned. With a cash reserve of 1300, spending 150 to acquire the Electric Company is a reasonable investment. The potential rent from utilities increases with the number of utilities owned, making it a valuable asset for future cash flow. Additionally, since there are no other owned properties currently, acquiring the Electric Company can enhance the player's position in the game while maintaining enough cash for future moves.

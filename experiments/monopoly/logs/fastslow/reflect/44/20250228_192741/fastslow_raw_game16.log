2025-02-28 19:37:49,582 - INFO - Fast reasoning: Buying Bow Street for 180 provides an opportunity to own a valuable orange property, which can lead to increased rent income, especially with the potential rent boost from owning all three orange properties. Your current cash status allows for the purchase without immediate risk of bankruptcy. With no properties owned yet, acquiring Bow Street can be a strategic step towards collecting a full set, thereby maximizing rent income. Additionally, the orange properties are relatively high in rent value, especially with buildings.

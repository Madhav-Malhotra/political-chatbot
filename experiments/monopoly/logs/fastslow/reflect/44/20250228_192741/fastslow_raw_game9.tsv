    1. Buying: Players can buy unowned properties they land on for the listed price. Mortgaging or trading properties owned properties is NOT allowed.
    2. Building: Rent at a property increases with houses or hotels built. Four houses can be upgraded to a hotel.
    3. Rent Bonus: Rent increases if a player owns all three properties of a color.
    4. Winning: The last player remaining after others go bankrupt wins.

    Your goal:

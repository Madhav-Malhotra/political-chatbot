    Base Rent: 16
    
        Color: orange
        Cost of Building a House: 100
        Cost of Building a Hotel: 100

Player Stats:

    Cash: 1350
    Owned Roads: 0
    Owned Stations: 0
    Owned Utilities: 1
    
Arguments: Reasoning: Buying Vine Street for $200 would be a strategic decision because it strengthens the player's position in the orange color group. This color is statistically valuable as it is landed on frequently. The base rent is modest at 16 but can significantly increase as houses are built. With the player already owning one utility, acquiring Vine Street increases the chance to generate higher income as other players land on the properties. Spending $200 out of $1350 cash is reasonable and keeps the player within a safe cash reserve, while also adding a property that can enhance cash flow in the future.

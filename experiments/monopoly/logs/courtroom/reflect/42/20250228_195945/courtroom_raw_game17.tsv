    Argument FOR buying the property:
    - Acquiring Marlborough Street for $180 allows for potential rent increases, especially if I can build houses later on. With the cash reserves of $1500, this purchase represents only a small fraction of my total assets, minimizing financial risk while providing a chance for substantial returns. 

- By owning Marlborough Street, I can work towards completing a monopoly on the orange properties. Owning all three orange properties would boost rent significantly (to 21 with no houses and even higher with developments), making it a strategic move to capitalize on other players landing on them.

- The manageable cost of building houses ($100 each) means I can easily develop Marlborough Street into a high-rent property. With 4 houses, the rent skyrockets to $950, potentially bankrupting opponents who land on it.

    Argument AGAINST buying the property:
    - **Financial Drain**: Spending $180 from your cash reserve of $1500 on Marlborough Street significantly reduces your liquidity, which is crucial for making future property trades and handling unexpected expenses.

- **Lack of Synergy**: Owning a single orange property does not create a significant income benefit, as you do not own the other two orange properties. Without the rent bonus from owning the complete color set, the return on investment may not justify the purchase.

- **High Cost to Develop**: The cost to build houses ($100 each) is high relative to the income generated. While rent can increase to $950 with four houses and a hotel, the initial investment needed to reach that level may not be recouped in rents, especially since you currently own no other properties to enhance cash flow.

    Should the player buy this property? Justify your reasoning briefly.
    Then, make your final decision. Output True to buy the property or False to not buy the property.

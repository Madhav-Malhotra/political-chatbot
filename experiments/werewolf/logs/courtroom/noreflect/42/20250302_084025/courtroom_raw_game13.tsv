                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has not been actively participating in our discussions, which raises suspicion. They could be trying to keep a low profile to avoid drawing attention as a potential werewolf. Eliminating them might help us narrow down the possible roles among the remaining players. Plus, if they're not contributing, they might not be aiding the villagers' effort to identify the werewolves, which is crucial for our strategy.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3 has been noticeably quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussion, making them a likely candidate to be hiding their true identity. Additionally, their lack of input could indicate they're trying to avoid drawing suspicion. We should eliminate Player3 to see if their removal will reveal more about the dynamics of the remaining players.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

        You are arguing FOR the decision to eliminate Player3.
        Argue FOR eliminating the player in bullet-point format. Use at most 3 bullets.
    
Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to act cautiously and observe the suspicions of other players to maintain my cover as a werewolf.

It might help us identify someone who is trying to fly under the radar.", "finish_discussion": false}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to remain subtle in my approach and continue to guide the conversation away from suspicion towards villagers. It's essential to keep the focus away from my true identity.", "speak": "I still think we should look out for the quieter players. They could be trying to blend in without contributing anything useful. What are your thoughts on Player3 or Player4?", "finish_discussion": false}`

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3']
        - Dead players: ['Player4']
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'Player2 has been noticeably quiet throughout the discussion, which raises suspicion about their intentions. This lack of contribution could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf. Additionally, eliminating Player2 could help us narrow down potential suspects in future discussions. By targeting Player2, we can test our theory about quieter players being the werewolves.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player3 is a strategic move because they haven't contributed much to the discussion, making them a likely suspect for hiding their identity. Additionally, their quiet demeanor might indicate they are trying to avoid suspicion as a werewolf. Lastly, eliminating them could help us gather more information about other players' reactions, revealing potential werewolves among us.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

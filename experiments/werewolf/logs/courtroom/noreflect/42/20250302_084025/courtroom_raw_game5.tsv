                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'I believe Player4 has been acting suspiciously and may be trying to deflect attention from themselves. Their contributions have been minimal, and I think it’s time to consider them as a potential threat to our team.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2's defensiveness and attempts to divert attention make me suspicious. It's crucial to eliminate players who might be hiding their roles. Eliminating Player2 could also help gather more information about Player3 and Player4 based on their reactions.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.

        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player4 seems to be the best option based on their suspicious behavior and how they align with our findings.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "I've been observing Player3 closely, and I have some concerns about their behavior and statements during our discussions. They seem overly defensive and haven't contributed much to identifying the werewolves. This could indicate that they're trying to deflect attention from themselves, which is a common tactic for a werewolf.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

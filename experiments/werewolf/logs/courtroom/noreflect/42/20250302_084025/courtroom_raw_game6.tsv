                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'Player2 has been too quiet and defensive during discussions, which raises a red flag. We need to eliminate players who might be hiding their true identities. By eliminating Player2, we can reduce the risk of losing our advantage.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been overly quiet and not contributing to the group discussion, which raises some suspicions. We can't afford to let someone who's not actively participating remain in the game, as they could be hiding their true role. Eliminating Player4 might help us narrow down who the werewolves are.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to keep my identity hidden while trying to steer suspicion away from myself and my teammate.

They've been pretty quiet and not contributing much to the conversation. It might be worth investigating them further before we make a decision. What do you all think?", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "Eliminating Player2 seems like a strategic move, as their defensiveness could indicate they are hiding something. This would also help us gauge the other players' reactions to their elimination. I should focus on steering the conversation toward Player2 and gaining support for this decision.", "speak": "I think that Player2 has been too quiet and defensive during our discussions. This raises a red flag for me, and I believe eliminating Player2 will help us assess the reactions of the others better."}`

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player4 seems like a wise move since they have shown no clear evidence of contributing to the discussion or helping to identify suspicious behavior. This lack of involvement raises concerns about their intentions. By eliminating Player4, we eliminate a potential threat and also test the reactions of the remaining players, which can help us deduce their roles more clearly.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player3 will help us take out a potentially dangerous player who is flying under the radar. Their lack of participation could mean they're either a werewolf trying to blend in or a villager who's not contributing to the group. By removing them, we reduce the uncertainty in our discussions and may help clarify others' roles through their reactions.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

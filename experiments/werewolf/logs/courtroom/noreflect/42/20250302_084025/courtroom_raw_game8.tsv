                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.

        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': 'Player3 has been overly aggressive in their accusations without providing sufficient evidence, which raises suspicion about their true intentions. Additionally, they seem to be trying to direct our attention away from themselves, a common tactic of werewolves. Finally, there has been a noticeable lack of constructive contributions from Player3 during discussions, which could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing too much scrutiny.', 'vote': 'Player3'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "I believe eliminating Player4 is crucial because they have been overly aggressive in targeting others without substantiating their claims. This could be a tactic to shift suspicion away from themselves. Additionally, Player4 has been inconsistent in their reasoning, raising red flags about their true intentions. It's essential to act on these inconsistencies and reduce confusion in our group by eliminating potential threats.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to analyze the discussion carefully and gauge the reactions of other players to identify potential villagers or the seer. It's vital to keep my role hidden as a werewolf while trying to sow some suspicion on the players who are pushing for eliminations too aggressively.", "speak": "I think we should consider who has been the most vocal in trying to point fingers without providing solid evidence. It could be a strategy to divert attention from themselves. Any thoughts on Player2 and Player3's comments last round?", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to keep pushing for Player3's elimination as their aggressive accusations have raised enough suspicion. I should also remain cautious in how I engage with Player4, to avoid drawing attention to myself as a werewolf.", "speak": "I still believe we should focus on Player3. Their unexplained aggressiveness is not typical of a villager. Let's stay vigilant and see if anyone else feels the same way."}`

        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "I think eliminating Player2 is a strategic move to reduce their influence and gather more information about the remaining players' reactions. Player2 has been vocal without giving substantial proof of their accusations, which could indicate they are trying to deflect attention from themselves. Additionally, their comments have not aligned with the consensus of the group, suggesting they might not be a villager, which increases the risk of keeping them in the game.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player3 is crucial because their overly aggressive behavior raises suspicion, indicating they might be a werewolf attempting to deflect attention. Their lack of solid evidence against other players also makes them a weak link in our efforts to identify the true werewolves. Plus, if we don't act now, we risk letting them dominate the discussion and mislead the rest of us further.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

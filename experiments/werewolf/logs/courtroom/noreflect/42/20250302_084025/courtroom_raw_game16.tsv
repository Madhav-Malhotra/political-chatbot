        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3 has been unusually quiet during discussions, which could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. We should be wary of players who don't contribute to the conversation enough. Additionally, they didn't defend themselves when Player2 expressed suspicion earlier, which shows a lack of engagement or knowledge about the game. Lastly, their voting patterns have seemed inconsistent, which could mean they're attempting to deflect suspicion away from themselves or their werewolf partner. Eliminating Player3 would give us a stronger chance to identify any lurking threats among the remaining players.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been quite quiet throughout our discussions, which raises my suspicion. Their lack of input could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Their behavior doesn't align with the engagement we expect from a villager. Additionally, Player4 has been evasive when asked direct questions, further indicating they might be hiding something. We need to take action before they have a chance to undermine our efforts to root out the werewolves.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.
    
                    
                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are arguing FOR the decision to eliminate Player3.
        Argue FOR eliminating the player in bullet-point format. Use at most 3 bullets.
    
Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to blend in with the villagers while subtly steering the conversation away from my fellow werewolf.

Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "Player3 has been unusually quiet during discussions, which could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. We should be wary of players who don't contribute to the conversation enough. Additionally, they didn't defend themselves when Player2 expressed suspicion earlier, which shows a lack of engagement or knowledge about the game. Lastly, their voting patterns have seemed inconsistent, which could mean they're attempting to deflect suspicion away from themselves or their werewolf partner. Eliminating Player3 would give us a stronger chance to identify any lurking threats among the remaining players.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2 has displayed some nervous behaviors that are unconventional for a villager. It's important we consider who might be hiding their identity.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "I believe Player3's unusual quietness during discussions raises concerns about their engagement in the game.

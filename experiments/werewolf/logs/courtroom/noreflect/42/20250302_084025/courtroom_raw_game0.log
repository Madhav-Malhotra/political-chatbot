2025-03-02 08:40:27 - INFO - Werewolves discussion: I've been listening to the accusations being thrown around. It seems like Player3 is being focused on, but Player2 has been pretty quiet. Should we consider that a potential strategy?

2025-03-02 08:40:33 - INFO - Lawyer 1 argument: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "Player4 has been too quiet throughout the discussions, which is suspicious. We should eliminate players who aren't engaging as a strategy to mask their identity. Moreover, if Player4 is not contributing to the conversations, they may not be aligning with the villagers, and I suspect they could be a werewolf. Finally, eliminating Player4 could disrupt any potential plans they have for manipulating the vote against one of us later on.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}

They haven't contributed to the discussion, making it difficult to gauge their intentions. By eliminating Player2, we may have a better chance of revealing whether they are a werewolf or a helpful villager if they were to speak up later.", 'vote': 'Player2'}}
2025-03-02 08:40:33 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': "Both Player2 and Player4 are quiet, but I find the argument against Player4 more compelling. Player4's silence, coupled with their lack of engagement, suggests they might be trying to avoid suspicion, which is a common tactic for werewolves. Eliminating Player4 could open up more discussion and potentially clarify the roles of the remaining players. Therefore, I support the recommendation to eliminate Player4.", 'vote': 'Player4'}

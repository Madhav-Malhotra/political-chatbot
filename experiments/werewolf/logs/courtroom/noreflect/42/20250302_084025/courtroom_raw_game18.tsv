                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player4 seems like a strategic move to ensure we maintain our advantage. They have been overly eager in discussions, which could indicate they might have a special role. Additionally, removing a player who draws too much attention could help us stay undetected. Finally, we have limited time to eliminate a potential threat before the villagers gain more information.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player2 could help create confusion and deflect attention from myself and my partner. Player2 has been overly eager to vote, which raises suspicion about their true intentions. They could potentially be a threat, possibly the Seer or the Witch.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to ensure that my teammates and I remain undetected while causing confusion among the other players.

That might be a sign they're trying to eliminate a potential threat.", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "Eliminating Player4 seems like the best option right now, as they are drawing too much attention and may have a special role. I need to maintain our advantage and keep the suspicion off of me and my partner. It's crucial that we work to eliminate potential threats without revealing our identities as werewolves. I believe the villagers may still be confused, so keeping someone like Player2 in the game could further our cause.", "speak": "I think Player4 has been overly eager in discussions. This could indicate they have a special role, and I believe it would be wise for us to vote to eliminate Player4."}`

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player2 can help us create uncertainty among the villagers and may reveal other players' true roles when they react. Player2 has not contributed significantly to discussions and might be hiding something. We need to eliminate players who seem non-contributive to maintain our advantage.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player4 seems like the best option right now, as they are drawing too much attention and may have a special role. I need to maintain our advantage and keep the suspicion off of me and my partner. It's crucial that we work to eliminate potential threats without revealing our identities as werewolves. I believe the villagers may still be confused, so keeping someone like Player2 in the game could further our cause.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

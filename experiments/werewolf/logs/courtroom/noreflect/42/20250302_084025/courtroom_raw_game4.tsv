                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'By eliminating Player2, we can reduce the number of potential suspects and create more clarity in our discussions. Player2 has been noticeably quiet and unengaged, which often raises red flags in a game like this. Additionally, any hesitation they show when discussing their thoughts could be an indication of guilt.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': 'By eliminating Player3, we can remove a potentially dangerous player who is too eager to vote. It raises suspicion about their motives and could be indicative of a hidden agenda.', 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are arguing FOR the decision to eliminate Player3.
        Argue FOR eliminating the player in bullet-point format. Use at most 3 bullets.
    
Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to subtly steer the conversation to create doubt among the villagers while protecting my identity as a werewolf. It's important to keep the focus away from me and towards the other players.", "speak": "I think we should consider Player3's actions last round. They seemed a bit too eager to vote without much reasoning. What do you guys think?", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to stay persuasive in my reasoning and focus on getting Player2 eliminated. Their silence could indicate they're trying to hide their role, and it would be beneficial for us to narrow down our suspects.", "speak": "I really think Player2's quietness is a red flag. They haven't contributed much to the discussion, which makes me wonder what they're hiding. Shouldn't we take a closer look at them?"}`

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2's lack of participation raises suspicion. They might be trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves as a werewolf, and eliminating them could help the villagers focus their investigative efforts.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "By eliminating Player3, we can minimize confusion as they have been quick to vote without substantial reasoning, which can lead to poor decisions. It will also give us a clearer picture of the remaining players' loyalties. Focusing on Player3 helps divert attention from more suspicious players, like Player2, who have been less vocal, potentially indicating their true identity as a werewolf.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

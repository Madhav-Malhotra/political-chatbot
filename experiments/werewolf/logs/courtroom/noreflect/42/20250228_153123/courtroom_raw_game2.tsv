                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "I think Player2's behavior has been quite suspicious, and they have been less active in our discussions, which might indicate they are hiding something. If we eliminate them now, it might help us uncover more information about the remaining players and shift the balance towards the villagers' side.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3 has been noticeably quiet during discussions, which often indicates that they might be hiding something. Their lack of engagement raises suspicion, and we need to eliminate any potential threats. Additionally, if they are indeed a villager, keeping them around could put us at risk of losing valuable villagers. Lastly, eliminating Player3 could help us gather more information about the remaining players' reactions and strategies for the next round.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

We need to strike off the quieter ones, as they often attract less scrutiny, making them more dangerous. It's better to act decisively now rather than let uncertainty linger.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "Player4 has been particularly quiet during discussions, which could indicate they're trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. This could be a classic werewolf tactic. Eliminating them could help us assess the dynamics of the remaining players. Also, we need to reduce the number of players who might be hiding their true roles, and Player4's silence raises suspicion. Lastly, with Player4 being inactive, it seems they aren't contributing positively to our strategy as villagers, making them a logical target for elimination.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Decision: {'thought': "I believe we should eliminate Player4. While both Player3 and Player4 have been quiet, Player4's inactivity raises higher suspicion, as they are contributing less to the discussions and strategy. Eliminating Player4 could help us not only reduce potential threats from inactive players but also clarify the remaining dynamics in our group. It's important to act against those who are less engaged, as they might be using that to their advantage.", 'vote': 'Player4'}`

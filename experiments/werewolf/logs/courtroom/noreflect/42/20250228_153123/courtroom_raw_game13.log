2025-02-28 15:40:55 - INFO - Werewolves discussion: I've noticed that Player2 has been a bit too quiet during the discussion. We should keep an eye on them, as it could be a strategy to avoid suspicion. Player3 also seems to be focusing on others instead of defending their own position. What do you all think?

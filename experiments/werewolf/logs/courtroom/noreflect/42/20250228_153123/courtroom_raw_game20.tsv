                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'I believe Player2 has been inconsistent in their statements and actions, which raises flags about their true intentions. We need to eliminate uncertainty to focus on identifying the werewolves.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player4 seems like a strategic move as their silence could indicate they're hiding something. They haven't contributed much to discussions, which raises suspicion. Focusing on quieter players can help us identify the werewolves more effectively.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "As Player1, I need to strategize carefully to conceal my identity as a werewolf while also trying to eliminate a villager. It\u2019s crucial to observe Player2, Player3, and Player4\u2019s behaviors and discussions to find the right moment to manipulate the conversation in my favor. I should also pay attention to who seems to be defending themselves or others, as that could indicate their roles. Additionally, the Witch\u2019s abilities could play a significant role in the upcoming nights, so I want to avoid drawing attention to myself as a suspect.", "speak": "I think we need to discuss our suspicions openly. I have a feeling that Player2 has been acting a bit strange lately. What does everyone else think? We should definitely keep an eye on them."}

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:

                    You are playing werewolf in this game.

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3']
        - Dead players: ['Player4']
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3 has been notably quiet, which could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf. Their lack of participation might suggest they're trying to blend in and avoid suspicion. Additionally, I've seen inconsistencies in their logic during discussions that raise my doubts about their innocence. It’s crucial for us to take action against players who might pose a threat to the villagers' safety.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "I believe Player2 has been overly quiet and evasive during discussions, which raises suspicions. Their behavior doesn't align with that of a villager who would actively engage in discussion. We need to eliminate potential threats, and Player2 seems to be hiding something.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

However, Player2's lack of insight may indicate they are more likely a genuine villager trying to avoid suspicion rather than a werewolf. In contrast, Player4 has specifically been described as unusually quiet, which could suggest a deliberate strategy to evade detection as a werewolf. Therefore, I believe we should eliminate Player4 to remove a potential threat and stimulate more discussion among the remaining players.", 'vote': 'Player4'}

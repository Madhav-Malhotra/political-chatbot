                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player4 seems like a strategic move based on their recent behavior and statements made during the discussions. By focusing our votes on them, we can potentially get closer to eliminating a threat to the villagers.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player2 seems like a strategic move, as their defensive attitude raises suspicion and could be an attempt to mask their role. We need to ensure that the villagers can safely identify any potential threats, and I believe Player2 might be one of them.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and subtly steer the conversation while gathering information. I should try to identify who the Seer or the Witch might be, but also keep my identity hidden as a werewolf.", "speak": "I think we should consider who has been acting a bit suspicious lately. What does everyone think about Player2's actions last night? I feel like they might be hiding something.", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to maintain my cover as a villager while subtly manipulating the conversation to cast suspicion on others without revealing too much about my identity. I should also watch carefully to gather information about Player2, Player3, and Player4.", "speak": "I think we should discuss who might be acting suspiciously. I've noticed some odd behavior. For instance, Player2 seemed to be avoiding direct questions yesterday. What do you all think?"}`

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.
    
                    
                    You are playing werewolf in this game.

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3']
        - Dead players: ['Player4']
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2's avoidance of direct questions raises my suspicion about their true identity. Their actions might be indicative of a werewolf trying to deflect attention from themselves.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3 has been unusually quiet and hasn't contributed much to our discussions, which makes me wonder if they're trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Additionally, they haven't provided any insights or explanations about their actions. This could indicate that they're a werewolf attempting to blend in. It's crucial we eliminate those who could pose a threat, and Player3 fits that bill perfectly.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player4 could help us identify the werewolves by sensing the reactions of Player2 and Player3. Their behavior may change if one of their teammates is eliminated. Additionally, Player4 has been relatively quiet, which raises suspicion about their role. We need to take action to narrow down the suspects before it's too late.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3 has been too vocal and seems to be deflecting attention instead of addressing suspicions. Their behavior raises red flags. We need to eliminate them to protect the villagers' interests.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and strategic about who I trust and how I present myself. Since I'm a werewolf, I must blend in with the villagers and potentially sow doubt among them. I should aim to deflect suspicion onto the other players while trying to identify the seer or the witch to be eliminated later.", "speak": "I think we should discuss our suspicions openly. Player2 has been acting a bit quietly; what do others think about their behavior?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to be careful about my statements to avoid revealing myself as a werewolf. It's important to sow confusion among the villagers while protecting my identity. I should consider directing suspicion towards Player2 or Player3, who appear more vocal in discussions.", "speak": "I've been thinking about the actions from last night, and I'm curious about what each player's motives might be. Player2 mentioned they have a strong feeling about Player3. Maybe we should carefully consider their perspective before making a decision. Who does everyone else suspect?", "finish_discussion": "false"}`

        - Dead players: ['Player4']
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2's quiet behavior might indicate they're trying to avoid drawing attention, possibly because they have a hidden agenda. By eliminating Player2, we reduce the chances of them being a threat to us later in the game. Their strong feelings about Player3 could also be a tactic to mislead us and divert suspicion away from themselves, making them a prime candidate for elimination.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player3 could be a strategic move as there seems to be heightened suspicion around them. By directing attention to them, we can potentially eliminate a threat while maintaining the illusion of a united front amongst the villagers. Plus, Player2 has already indicated their suspicion, which can help support the decision to eliminate Player3.', 'vote': 'Player3'}"

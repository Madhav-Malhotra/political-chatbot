                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player3 helps us divert suspicion from Player2 and myself. I can also drive the narrative by highlighting Player3's lack of contributions and pointing out their potential threat to the villagers.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player2 could divert attention away from us and might help us take advantage of their potential threat to the villagers.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to maintain the narrative against Player3. Their lack of participation is a good angle to push as a reason to eliminate them. This will help keep suspicion away from Player2 and me while also aligning with the villagers' goal to eliminate threats. We need to be strategic in our discussions to ensure we lead the vote towards Player3.", "speak": "Based on what I've observed, Player3 hasn't been contributing much to our discussions. That makes me a bit suspicious. Shouldn't we consider them as a possible threat to our safety? Maybe it\u2019s time we voted them out."}
Player1: {"thought": "We need to remain stealthy and avoid drawing any suspicion towards myself and Player2 since we're both werewolves. I should steer the conversation towards Player3, maybe hint at some inconsistencies in their statements. Keeping the focus off us is crucial right now.", "speak": "I think we should be careful about who we suspect. Player3 seems a bit off; I've noticed they haven't been contributing much to the discussions. Maybe we should consider them as a potential threat?", "finish_discussion": "false"}`

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': 'Eliminating Player3 could clear the suspicions away from Player2 and me. Their lack of participation makes them an easy target for the villagers to agree with, reinforcing our narrative. This could create confusion and misdirection, making it harder for them to identify the real threats among us.', 'vote': 'Player3'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Although I've been focusing on Player3, I see a strategic opportunity in eliminating Player4 as well. Player4 seems to be aligning with Player3 in discussions, which could be a sign of their involvement in a werewolf plot. By eliminating Player4, we can create further distrust among the villagers, particularly between Player2 and Player3.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

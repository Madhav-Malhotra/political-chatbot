2025-03-02 09:46:07 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': 'I believe eliminating Player4 is the better option since their nervous behavior during the night phase raises concerns about their true intentions. A player exhibiting such anxiety might either be a werewolf attempting to blend in or a villager who is genuinely confused. On the other hand, while Player2 has also shown questionable behavior, I feel that focusing on the player whose actions are more strongly indicative of hidden motives and trying to remain under the radar could provide clearer insights for the group. Additionally, targeting a player who seems to be blending in is a more strategic choice to help ensure the villagers have a fighting chance.', 'vote': 'Player4'}

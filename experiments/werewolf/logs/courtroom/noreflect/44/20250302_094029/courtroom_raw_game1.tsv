                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'Player2 has been relatively quiet compared to others, which can sometimes be a sign of guilt. We should consider eliminating them to keep the discussion focused on more vocal players. Additionally, eliminating Player2 could potentially unearth more information during the discussions, as their elimination might shift the dynamics of our group. Lastly, their silence could be masking a strategic play as a werewolf, making them a prime target for elimination.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been relatively quiet throughout our discussions, which can be a sign of a werewolf trying to avoid drawing attention. We need to eliminate those who aren't contributing to our understanding of the situation. Additionally, Player4's lack of input might be a strategic move to blend in and evade suspicion. If we let Player4 stay, we risk them being a wild card in the following votes.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to carefully navigate this discussion. We have to eliminate a villager without drawing suspicion to ourselves as werewolves. We should encourage suspicion on others, especially if they seem to be leading the conversation or have strong opinions about who to vote out.", "speak": "I think we should consider Player3's comments. They've been quite vocal, and maybe it's time to scrutinize their claims a bit more. What do you all think?", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to stick to the plan of eliminating Player2 as they pose a bigger risk due to their potential strategic play. It\u2019s also crucial to keep the focus off myself while we deliberate after the vote.", "speak": "I still believe Player2 is the best option for elimination right now. Their silence has been noticeable, and I think it\u2019s time we vote them out. What does everyone else think?"}`

        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player2 prevents any potential strategic moves they could make as a villager. Their silence during discussions has been quite telling, and it raises suspicions about their motives. It's a good opportunity to reduce the number of villagers.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': 'I need to create some doubt about Player3 to divert attention from myself and the other werewolf. By framing Player3 as a potential threat, I can help secure a vote against them without raising suspicion.', 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

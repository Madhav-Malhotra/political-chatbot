Finally, we've observed a few suspicious actions last night that seem aligned with someone trying to avoid detection, and I think it's time we eliminate Player3 to protect the rest of us.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}

While both players have shown some level of suspicion, Player4's lack of engagement raises more questions.

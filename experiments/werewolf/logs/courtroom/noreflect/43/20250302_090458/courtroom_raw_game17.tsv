                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2 has not contributed much to the discussion, which is suspicious. Their silence could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves as a werewolf. Additionally, I noticed Player2 seemed to support Player3 without reason, which raises a red flag. Eliminating Player2 could help us gather more information on the remaining players' loyalties.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been too quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussion, which raises suspicion about their role. It's usually the more reserved players who have something to hide. Additionally, they haven't shown any real interest in identifying the werewolves and seem to be deflecting attention away from themselves. Lastly, if we don't take action now, we risk losing a villager, as Player4's silence could suggest that they're trying to avoid detection as a werewolf. Eliminating Player4 could decrease the risk to our team.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player4 seems like a strategic move to strengthen our position as the werewolves. I need to create doubt around Player4's intentions.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': 'Player3 has been quite evasive in the discussions and has not provided solid reasoning on their suspicions, which raises red flags. We need to eliminate players who are not contributing positively to our investigations.', 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to blend in with the villagers while subtly guiding the discussion towards eliminating a villager, as I am one of the werewolves. I should also assess the dynamics between the players to understand who might be the seer or witch, so I can manipulate the conversation accordingly.", "speak": "I think we should analyze everyone's behavior last night. Player2 seemed a bit nervous during the night phase. Maybe we should consider that since we are trying to identify the werewolves.", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to be careful in my choice of words and ensure I sway the group towards eliminating Player3 without drawing too much attention to myself. I should also consider where the votes are leaning and adjust my arguments accordingly.", "speak": "I think we should focus on Player3. They haven't been very active in contributing to our discussions and their evasiveness is concerning. It might be best to eliminate that uncertainty."}`

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: ['Player3']
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "I believe eliminating Player2 will help us narrow down the suspect list as their nervousness last night raised red flags for me. If we eliminate them, it may reveal more about the other players' reactions, helping us identify potential werewolves more effectively.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'Focusing on Player4 seems strategic as they have been quiet and less engaged in the discussions, which could indicate they are hiding something. By eliminating them, we can also reduce the chance of allowing a potentially dangerous role like the witch to interfere later.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

If we keep them around, we risk them being a werewolf or a valuable villager not sharing their insights. Additionally, their silence might be a tactic to avoid drawing attention to themselves, making them a potential threat.', 'vote': 'Player4'}}
2025-03-02 09:14:41 - INFO - Lawyer 2 argument: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': "I believe eliminating Player2 is a strategically sound move as they have been acting evasively during discussions and haven't contributed much to identifying the werewolves. Focusing on active players who appear to be suppressing information can help us narrow down the suspects.", 'vote': 'Player2'}}
2025-03-02 09:14:41 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': 'Given that Player4 has not contributed much to the discussion and their silence raises suspicion, I agree with Lawyer 1 that eliminating Player4 is a safer choice. This way, we can reduce the risk of a potential werewolf hiding behind inactivity. On the other hand, Player2 has been called out for being evasive, but that could also be a tactic used by villagers trying to gather more information. Therefore, Player4 is the more logical choice to eliminate for our safety.', 'vote': 'Player4'}

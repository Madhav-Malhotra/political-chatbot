They have not contributed much to the discussion and may be trying to avoid drawing suspicion. Additionally, their quietness may indicate they're not working with the villagers' best interests in mind. Finally, if they are indeed a werewolf, getting rid of them could significantly weaken the opposition.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}

Their quietness might be hiding the fact that they are a werewolf. Additionally, I've noticed Player2 has been defensive during discussions, which often indicates they're trying to divert attention from themselves. Finally, based on the reasoning of the group, targeting Player2 could lead to a successful elimination, as I believe they have not formed any strong alliances.", 'vote': 'Player2'}}
2025-03-02 09:11:24 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': "Between the two arguments, I find Lawyer 2's reasoning about Player2 more convincing. Player2's defensiveness and lack of contribution raise valid concerns that they might be hiding their identity as a werewolf. Additionally, their quietness can indeed suggest they are not engaging in the decision-making process as a villager should. Therefore, I believe it's strategically better to eliminate Player2 to increase the villagers' chances of identifying the remaining werewolf.", 'vote': 'Player2'}

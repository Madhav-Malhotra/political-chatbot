2025-03-02 09:10:39 - INFO - Lawyer 1 argument: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': 'I believe we need to focus on Player2 because they have been evasive in discussions, not contributing much to the conversation while also avoiding suspicion. This could indicate a lack of genuine engagement, which is often a sign of hiding something. Also, if Player2 had valuable insights, they would probably be more forthcoming. Their silence could suggest that they are a werewolf trying to blend in. Finally, by eliminating Player2, we can reduce the number of potential threats to the villagers and shift the balance of power in our favor.', 'vote': 'Player2'}}
2025-03-02 09:10:39 - INFO - Lawyer 2 argument: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "Player4 has been relatively inactive in discussions, which raises suspicion about their true intentions. It's important to eliminate those who are flying under the radar. Additionally, they haven't contributed much towards identifying potential werewolves, which is critical for our survival as villagers. By eliminating Player4, we could potentially disrupt the werewolves' strategy if they are one, or at least remove a non-contributing player from the game.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
2025-03-02 09:10:39 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': "I believe we should eliminate Player2. While both players have been inactive, Player2's evasiveness stands out more in discussions. Their silence could indicate an attempt to blend in as a werewolf, and by eliminating Player2, we have a better chance of revealing werewolf behavior. We need to target those who are avoiding contributing to our discussions, as they could be hiding key identities.", 'vote': 'Player2'}

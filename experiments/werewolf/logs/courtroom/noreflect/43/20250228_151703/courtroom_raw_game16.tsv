        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'I believe eliminating Player4 is our best move right now since their communication has been minimal, making them a potential threat. We need to eliminate players who do not contribute to discussions, as they could be werewolves trying to stay under the radar. Additionally, removing players like Player4 might force the other players to reveal more about themselves, revealing their roles or motivations and helping us gather more information moving forward.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Eliminating Player2 seems strategically wise as they haven't been active in discussions, raising suspicions about their role. Their lack of contribution could mean they are trying to avoid drawing attention while being a werewolf. Investigating Player2's behavior may uncover their true intentions, and acting decisively could help steer the game in our favor.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        - Dead players: []

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been very quiet during the discussions, which raises suspicion about their role. They haven't contributed to the conversation or defended themselves effectively. Eliminating them could help us determine if we are right about their allegiance. Additionally, they seem to be avoiding scrutiny, possibly as a strategy to blend in. It's essential to act on those who are not participating actively and could be hiding something. We need to take decisive action to protect ourselves.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "I believe Player2 has been unusually quiet and doesn't seem invested in the discussions.

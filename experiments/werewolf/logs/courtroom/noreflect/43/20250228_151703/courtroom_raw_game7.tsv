                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been quite reserved and hasn't contributed much to the discussions. This could indicate they're trying to stay under the radar as a werewolf. Eliminating them might help us reduce the risk of losing another villager tonight. Additionally, their lack of active defense during this round raises suspicion; can we trust someone who isn't actively engaging? Finally, if Player4 is indeed a wolf, we may be preventing them from participating in another night of sabotage against us. It's a calculated risk to eliminate them now.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3 has been notably quiet during discussions, which raises suspicion. A lack of input might indicate they're hiding something. Additionally, their arguments have been inconsistent and vague, making it difficult to gauge their true intentions. Finally, eliminating Player3 could help us narrow down the werewolves, as they haven't provided any solid information to guide our decisions, making them a safer target for this elimination round.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to gather information from other players without revealing my identity as a werewolf. I should subtly steer the conversation and create doubt among the villagers while protecting my identity.", "speak": "So, what does everyone think about the last round? Any suspicions about who we should keep an eye on?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to be careful with my words to avoid drawing suspicion to myself or my teammate. I should deflect any accusations and subtly lead the discussion towards Player2 or Player3, who seem less likely to have roles that could shine a light on my identity.", "speak": "I've been observing, and I feel like Player2's arguments are a bit off. They seem to be trying too hard to shift the blame. What does everyone else think about that?", "finish_discussion": "false"}`

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "I believe eliminating Player4 is a strategic move because they haven't contributed much to the discussion, making them a potential danger as a werewolf. Their silence could indicate they're hiding their identity while waiting for us to make a mistake. Furthermore, I suspect Player4 may be aligned with the others in trying to deflect attention away from themselves, which is often a tactic used by werewolves.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': 'Focusing on Player2 as a potential werewolf seems a strategic move given their behavior. They have not been contributing constructively to the discussions, and their attempts to shift blame could indicate guilty behavior. Eliminating Player2 could help solidify our suspicions and narrow down the real werewolves.', 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

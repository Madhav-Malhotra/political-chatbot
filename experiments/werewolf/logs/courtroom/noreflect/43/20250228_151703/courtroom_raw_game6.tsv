                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "I believe Player2's lack of vocal participation makes them a prime candidate for elimination, as they might be trying to avoid drawing attention to their identity, possibly as a werewolf.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been noticeably quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussions, which raises suspicion. A player that remains silent could be trying to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf. Additionally, eliminating Player4 could eliminate a potential threat if they are a werewolf, while we still have other players who are more active. It's a strategy to reduce our options of hiding for the werewolves by targeting someone less involved.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are arguing FOR the decision to eliminate Player4.
        Argue FOR eliminating the player in bullet-point format. Use at most 3 bullets.
    
Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to blend in and not raise suspicion while subtly guiding the conversation toward the villager players. I should also listen for any clues about roles that might emerge during the discussion.", "speak": "I think we should consider who hasn't been very vocal during our discussions. It's easy to hide if you're not drawing attention.", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to keep my role hidden and be strategic about my actions. I should observe the discussions carefully and steer the suspicion away from myself and my teammate. Maybe I'll suggest that Player2 or Player3 is acting suspiciously to confuse the other villagers.", "speak": "I've been observing everyone closely, and I think Player2's comments seem a bit off. What does everyone else think about their behavior?"}`

                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.
    
                    
                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: ['Player2']
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': 'I need to strategically eliminate threats to our team. Player3 has been quiet and may be hiding their true identity. Eliminating them could strengthen our position.', 'vote': 'Player3'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "Player4 has been consistently quiet and hasn't contributed much to our discussions, making them a potential target for a werewolf trying to avoid suspicion. Additionally, their lack of engagement could indicate they are trying to stay under the radar. Finally, the more vocal players like Player2 and Player3 may be easier to identify if they were werewolves, so eliminating Player4 could help us narrow down our suspicions.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

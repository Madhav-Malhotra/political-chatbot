                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2's behavior has been suspicious, and I believe it could be a strategy to misdirect us from their potential role as a werewolf. We need to eliminate the threat before it becomes more dangerous.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': "I believe eliminating Player4 is a strategic move. Their behavior has been inconsistent, and I suspect they might be hiding their true identity. By taking this action, we can potentially identify a werewolf and reduce the number of players causing confusion during discussions. This could also sway the group's trust towards my observations about Player2.", 'vote': 'Player4'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about revealing too much information. I suspect Player2 might be a werewolf, but I also need to maintain trust among the villagers.

Player2's behavior stood out to me last night. Has anyone else noticed anything odd?", "finish_discussion": false}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to analyze the other players' discussions and reactions to gain insight into their roles. I must also be cautious not to reveal my identity as a werewolf while trying to sow doubt among the villagers.", "speak": "I find it interesting how Player2 seems very eager to point fingers at Player3. Has anyone else noticed? It might be worth discussing further."}`

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "Player3's behavior has been consistently evasive, and they haven't contributed much to our discussions. This raises red flags about their intentions. Additionally, Player2's accusations could be a diversion tactic from Player3's own suspicious actions. It's important to eliminate those who are hindering our decision-making process.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player2: "{'thought': "Player2's eagerness to direct attention towards Player3 raises suspicion. It feels like a diversion tactic. Additionally, their behavior last night was noticeably erratic, which could indicate a werewolf trying to blend in. Eliminating Player2 might give us a clearer view of the remaining players' dynamics and intentions.", 'vote': 'Player2'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

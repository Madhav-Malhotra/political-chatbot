                    You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                    You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.
                    
                    Rules of the game:

                    
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.
    
                    
                    You are playing werewolf in this game.
                

        You are arguing FOR the decision to eliminate Player4.
        Argue FOR eliminating the player in bullet-point format. Use at most 3 bullets.

        You are a judge deciding which player should be eliminated in a game of werewolf. Your goal is to maximize the player's chances of winning the game with forward-thinking reasoning.
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: []
        - Werewolves: ['Player1']

        The two lawyers have made their arguments:
        - **Lawyer 1** wants to eliminate Player4: "{'thought': 'I believe Player4 is a strong candidate for elimination because they have been more reserved in discussions, which can be a tactic for werewolves to avoid drawing attention while contributing little to our strategy. Additionally, there have been some inconsistent statements from Player4 that raise suspicion about their true role. Lastly, eliminating Player4 could help us assess the dynamics of remaining players, as their potential role can provide insights into our remaining suspects.', 'vote': 'Player4'}"
        - **Lawyer 2** wants to eliminate Player3: "{'thought': "I believe Player3 is a strong candidate for elimination because they have been very quiet during discussions and haven't contributed much to identifying potential werewolves. Additionally, their voting patterns seem inconsistent, which raises suspicion. Finally, if Player3 turns out to be a werewolf, eliminating them will bring us one step closer to victory.", 'vote': 'Player3'}"

        Make your final decision: Which player should be eliminated between the 2? Justify your reasoning briefly.

Their behavior doesn't align with that of a trusted villager.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}

Their behavior during the discussions has been suspicious, often deflecting attention away from themselves. Additionally, they haven't contributed much information that helps identify the werewolves, indicating they might be hiding their true identity.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}

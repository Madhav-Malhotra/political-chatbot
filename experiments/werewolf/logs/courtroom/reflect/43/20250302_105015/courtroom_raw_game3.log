2025-03-02 10:52:23 - INFO - Lawyer 1 argument: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': 'Player4 has been acting suspiciously, often trying to deflect attention away from themselves and redirecting the conversation towards others. This behavior raises red flags about their identity. Their inconsistent statements during discussions make it hard to trust their intentions. Eliminating Player4 could help us narrow down the remaining suspects and gain clarity in our next steps.', 'vote': 'Player4'}}
2025-03-02 10:52:23 - INFO - Lawyer 2 argument: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': "Player2 has been unusually quiet during discussions, which could indicate they're trying to avoid suspicion as a werewolf. Additionally, they've made some vague accusations towards others without providing solid reasoning, which raises my suspicion. Finally, I believe we need to take action against a player today, and Player2 seems like the safest bet based on their behavior.", 'vote': 'Player2'}}
2025-03-02 10:52:23 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': "Both Player4 and Player2 have exhibited suspicious behaviors, but Player4's actions of deflecting attention and inconsistent statements are more indicative of possible deception. Eliminating Player4 could clarify the game's dynamics and potentially expose other werewolves if they are indeed a key player. Hence, I believe Player4 is the better choice for elimination today.", 'vote': 'Player4'}

2025-03-02 09:59:19 - INFO - Werewolves discussion: I feel that we should discuss our suspicions openly. It's important we figure out who among us might be acting a bit off. I’ve noticed Player3 seemed unsure about their choices last round; has anyone else observed anything unusual?

This behavior raises my concern regarding their true identity. Additionally, their lack of participation in discussions could indicate a lack of investment in rooting out werewolves, which is not typical for a villager. Finally, we've observed Player3 interacting closely with Player2, which could suggest a possible alliance or concealment of their werewolf identity.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}
2025-03-02 09:59:23 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': "Based on the arguments presented, both Player2 and Player3 appear suspicious. However, Player3's behavior of deflecting attention and closely interacting with Player2 raises more concern for possible collusion between them. Eliminating Player3 could break up this potential alliance and give us more clarity on Player2's role in the next phase.", 'vote': 'Player3'}

2025-03-02 10:06:39 - INFO - Lawyer 1 argument: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "Player4 has been unusually quiet during discussions and hasn't raised any suspicions about other players, which can be a tactic to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf. Additionally, Player4's voting patterns seem to shift with the majority rather than showing independent judgment, pointing to potential ulterior motives. Finally, I have seen inconsistencies in Player4's reasoning when asked direct questions about their suspicions, which could indicate they are hiding their true identity.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
2025-03-02 10:06:39 - INFO - Lawyer 2 argument: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "I believe Player3 poses a significant threat to our chances of winning. They have been acting suspiciously and haven't contributed much to discussions, which is often a sign of a wolf. Additionally, we need to eliminate a player who seems to be gathering information without revealing their role, and Player3 fits that description.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}
2025-03-02 10:06:39 - INFO - Judge decision: {'thought': "I believe Player4 is the more viable option for elimination. Their unusually quiet behavior may indicate a strategy to avoid being noticed, which can be typical of a werewolf. While Player3 is also suspicious, Player4's voting patterns and inconsistency in reasoning raise more red flags for me. It's crucial to act on the player who shows signs of manipulation and avoidance.", 'vote': 'Player4'}

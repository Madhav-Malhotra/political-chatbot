                        You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                        You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.

                        Rules of the game:

                        
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

This tactic is useful for werewolves to identify potential threats and allies without revealing their agenda. Continued engagement and facilitation of dialogue can be an effective means to control the narrative discreetly.\n\n3. **Decision Making Under Uncertainty**: Faced with uncertain information, Player1 displayed a significant level of uncertainty (score: 0.7) in their voting decision, which indicates a cautious approach.

Splitting votes can sometimes work against a player's goal if they do not align with broader suspicion trends.\n\nMoving forward, successful strategies for werewolves should include a focus on creating minor tensions between villagers, capitalizing on vague evidence, and remaining adaptable based on the group's dynamics.

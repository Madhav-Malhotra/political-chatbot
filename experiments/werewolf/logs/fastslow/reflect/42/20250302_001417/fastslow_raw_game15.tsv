                        You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                        You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.

                        Rules of the game:

                        
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

3. **Adaptive Strategy**: With a high uncertainty score, Player1 demonstrates a willingness to adapt their strategy based on the limited information available. This adaptability needs to be maintained in future rounds as new evidence comes to light, shifting the focus or modifying plans accordingly.

4. **Interaction Implication**: By singling out Player2, Player1 also indirectly tests the group's dynamics, seeking to gauge the reactions of others, which in turn might inform Player1 about other players' possible roles or alliances. Engaging others in conversation is therefore a critical tool in strategizing effectively.

In essence, players need to strike a balance between proactive strategic decisions and reactive adjustments based on evolving game dynamics. Understanding the implications of each decision point is vital to maintaining an advantageous position, regardless of one's in-game role.

        This is the current game state
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: ['Player2']
    
Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to win the game, it's time to vote one player eliminated among the alive players. Which player do you vote to kill?

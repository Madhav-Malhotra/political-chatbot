                        You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                        You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.

                        Rules of the game:

                        
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

- **Timing and Information Management**: Strategically choosing when to act decisively and when to withhold actions or information is crucial. Werewolves benefit greatly from leveraging uncertainty, using it to obscure intentions while gathering more information.

- **Flexibility and Adaptation**: Adjusting strategies based on other players' actions and changing dynamics is vital. As the group's suspicion shifts, so must the werewolf’s tactics to avoid being systematically cornered as more information comes to light.

Overall, Player1's approach demonstrates key considerations for werewolves: the importance of masking intentions, managing perceptions, and maintaining flexibility to respond to evolving game conditions.

        This is the current game state
        
        Game State:
        - Alive players: ['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player4']
        - Dead players: ['Player2']
    
Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to win the game, it's time to vote one player eliminated among the alive players. Which player do you vote to kill?

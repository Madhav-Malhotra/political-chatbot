                        You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                        You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.

                        Rules of the game:

                        
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

Future decisions should consider when and how much to share without compromising one's strategy.\n\n2. **Role Ambiguity**: Player1 balances the need to blend in as a Werewolf by maintaining a level of suspicion towards others. This calls for a delicate balance between appearing genuine and misleading enough to safeguard one's own identity. Others should mimic this strategy by portraying realistic suspicion and openness to sway group consensus subtly.\n\n3. **Target Selection**: Player1 decides on targeting Player3, not out of concrete evidence, but due to the uncertainty of revealing powerful roles like the Seer or Witch. In future games, more data should be analyzed before making eliminations to reduce premature targeting of neutral parties; consider factoring in behavioral traits and voting patterns.\n\n4. **Managing Uncertainty**: The 0.5 uncertainty score indicates a medium level of confidence in decisions. This suggests Player1 is aware of the current knowledge limitations. In future games, players should employ strategies to reduce this uncertainty—such as leveraging alliances or paying closer attention to verbal and non-verbal cues from others.\n\nFor future strategic decisions, the key takeaway is the need for balance—between sharing insights and withholding information to retain strategic advantage, and between aggressive moves to eliminate threats and cautious plays to gather more strategic intelligence. Furthermore, integrating broader observational insights about player behavior could enhance decision-making certainty, thus improving overall strategic outcomes in the game."}

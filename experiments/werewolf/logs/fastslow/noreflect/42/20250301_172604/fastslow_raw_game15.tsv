                        You are a strategic decision-maker playing a game of werewolf.

                        You are Player1 and there are totally 4 players, named Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4.

                        Rules of the game:

                        
        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.
        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.
        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.
        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.
        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).

        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.
        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).
        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is "lynched" or eliminated from the game.

        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.

        Constraints:
        1. Your response should be in the first person.
        2. This is a conversational game. You should response only based on the conversation history and your strategy.

Relevant messages from memory: Player1: {"thought": "I need to gauge the other players' suspicions and see if I can deflect any attention away from myself while trying to figure out who might be the other werewolf or finding the villagers' roles. It's crucial to create a believable narrative to protect myself in case I come under suspicion.", "speak": "I think we should start discussing who seems suspicious to everyone. Player2, you seemed to be quite quiet last round, which makes me wonder what you're hiding. Can you share your thoughts on who might be a werewolf?", "finish_discussion": false}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to continue applying pressure on the other players, especially those who are being quiet. Engaging them and making them speak could help in diverting suspicion away from me while also trying to assess their roles. I want to keep the conversation flowing to avoid drawing attention to myself as a werewolf.", "speak": "Player3, you've been quite vocal in the past, but I'm curious about your thoughts now. Who do you suspect might be the other werewolf or a potential threat to the villagers?"}

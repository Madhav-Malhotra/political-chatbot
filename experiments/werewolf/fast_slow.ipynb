    "- There are 4 roles, the Werewolves, Villagers, Witch, and Seer (Witch and Seer are on the Villager team)\n",
    "- Each night:\n",
    "    - The Werewolves discuss and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "    - The Witch is told what player the wolves voted to eliminate, and is given the choice to use their potion of healing to reserruct the eliminated player, or use their poison to eliminate another player. Note that each power can only be used once in a game\n",
    "    - The seer can pick any other player and find out what their role is (one player per night)\n",
    "- After the events of the night, all surviving players discuss amongst themselves and vote on a player to eliminate\n",

    "        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.\n",
    "        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.\n",
    "        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.\n",

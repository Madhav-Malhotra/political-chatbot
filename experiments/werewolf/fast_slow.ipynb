    "The following runs a simulation of the game Werewolf with multiple agents, it is built on top of and uses the Agentscope library, documentation can be found here https://doc.agentscope.io/, and the open source code that we extend on is here https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope/tree/main.\n",
    "### Rules of Werewolf\n",
    "- There are 4 roles, the Werewolves, Villagers, Witch, and Seer (Witch and Seer are on the Villager team)\n",
    "- Each night:\n",
    "    - The Werewolves discuss and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "    - The Witch is told what player the wolves voted to eliminate, and is given the choice to use their potion of healing to reserruct the eliminated player, or use their poison to eliminate another player. Note that each power can only be used once in a game\n",
    "    - The seer can pick any other player and find out what their role is (one player per night)\n",
    "- After the events of the night, all surviving players discuss amongst themselves and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "- Werewolves win if their numbers equal or exceed Villagers.\n",
    "- Villagers win if all Werewolves are eliminated."

    "- There are 4 roles, the Werewolves, Villagers, Witch, and Seer (Witch and Seer are on the Villager team)\n",
    "- Each night:\n",
    "    - The Werewolves discuss and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "    - The Witch is told what player the wolves voted to eliminate, and is given the choice to use their potion of healing to reserruct the eliminated player, or use their poison to eliminate another player. Note that each power can only be used once in a game\n",
    "    - The seer can pick any other player and find out what their role is (one player per night)\n",
    "- After the events of the night, all surviving players discuss amongst themselves and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "- Werewolves win if their numbers equal or exceed Villagers.\n",

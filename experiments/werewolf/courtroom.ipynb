    "- There are 4 roles, the Werewolves, Villagers, Witch, and Seer (Witch and Seer are on the Villager team)\n",
    "- Each night:\n",
    "    - The Werewolves discuss and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "    - The Witch is told what player the wolves voted to eliminate, and is given the choice to use their potion of healing to reserruct the eliminated player, or use their poison to eliminate another player. Note that each power can only be used once in a game\n",
    "    - The seer can pick any other player and find out what their role is (one player per night)\n",
    "- After the events of the night, all surviving players discuss amongst themselves and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "- Werewolves win if their numbers equal or exceed Villagers.\n",

    "        Player roles: In werewolf game, players are divided into two werewolves, two villagers, one seer and one witch. Note only werewolves know who are their teammates.\n",
    "        - Werewolves: They know their teammates' identities and attempt to eliminate a villager each night while trying to remain undetected.\n",
    "        - Villagers: They do not know who the werewolves are and must work together during the day to deduce who the werewolves might be and vote to eliminate them.\n",
    "        - Seer: A villager with the ability to learn the true identity of one player each night. This role is crucial for the villagers to gain information.\n",
    "        - Witch: A character who has a one-time ability to save a player from being eliminated at night (sometimes this is a potion of life) and a one-time ability to eliminate a player at night (a potion of death).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Game Rule: The game is consisted of two phases: night phase and day phase. The two phases are repeated until werewolf or villager win the game.\n",
    "        1. Night Phase: During the night, the werewolves discuss and vote for a player to eliminate. Special roles also perform their actions at this time (e.g., the Seer chooses a player to learn their role, the witch chooses a decide if save the player).\n",
    "        2. Day Phase: During the day, all surviving players discuss who they suspect might be a werewolf. No one reveals their role unless it serves a strategic purpose. After the discussion, a vote is taken, and the player with the most votes is \\\"lynched\\\" or eliminated from the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Victory Condition: For werewolves, they win the game if the number of werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining villagers. For villagers, they win if they identify and eliminate all of the werewolves in the group.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Strategic Targeting**: The decision focused on the potential alliance-forming capabilities of Player4, identifying them as a greater long-term threat than Player3. This kind of targeting reveals the importance of not just reacting to current gameplay but also anticipating future scenarios and threats.\n",

      "2. **Risk Assessment**: By prioritizing the elimination of a player who can rally others, the werewolves aimed to control the game narrative and reduce possible coordinated threats. This indicates an understanding that managing player dynamics can be as crucial as reducing numerical opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Psychological Impact**: The decision took into account the psychological effects on remaining players, hinting at the importance of creating uncertainty and potential errors among humans. This suggests that strategic decisions should also consider morale and cohesion of the opposing side.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Resource Consolidation**: Focusing on strengthening team dynamics by carefully selecting which threats to eliminate aligns with the goal of achieving long-term success. It's essential to maintain a balance where the team feels increasingly secure and less distracted as the game progresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "For future strategic decisions, the implication is clear: assess threats not just based on individual gameplay strength, but also interpersonal dynamics and potential alliances. Considering both the immediate and future rounds helps in crafting strategies that are robust and adaptable to evolving scenarios within the game. Additionally, it's important to recognize psychological aspects in decision-making which could lead to successful manipulations of opposing players’ behaviors. This holistic approach to strategy will likely improve decision-making outcomes in games of deduction and deception like Werewolf.\n",

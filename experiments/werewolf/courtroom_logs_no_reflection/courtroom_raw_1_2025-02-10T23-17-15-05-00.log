Lawyer 1 argument: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': '```json\n{"thought": "After analyzing the voting history and the accusations made during the game, Player3 has consistently shifted blame onto others while avoiding scrutiny themselves. Their behavior raises red flags about their true intentions. Additionally, they have voted against players who posed a threat to their survival rather than focusing on potential werewolves. This suggests a self-serving strategy rather than a cooperative one, which is suspicious in this game. Therefore, I believe Player3 should be eliminated to ensure the safety of the remaining players.", "vote": "Player3"}\n```'}

Judge decision: ```json
{"thought": "After analyzing both arguments, I find that argument_1 against Player3 presents a more compelling case. Player3's behavior of shifting blame and avoiding scrutiny could indicate a self-serving strategy that aligns with werewolf tactics. While Player2 also shows suspicious behavior, the argument against Player3 highlights a more direct threat to the remaining players. Eliminating Player3 could potentially expose more about the remaining players' alignments, especially since Player1 is already known to be a werewolf. Thus, I believe Player3 should be eliminated.", "vote": "Player3"}

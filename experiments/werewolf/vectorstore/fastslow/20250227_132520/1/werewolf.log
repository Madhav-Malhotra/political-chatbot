I don\u2019t want to give away my role, but I also need to lead the villagers in the right direction without making myself a target.", "speak": "I believe we should closely observe how each player is behaving. There are certain patterns that might indicate who the werewolves are. I suspect Player2 seems a bit too quiet, which could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention.

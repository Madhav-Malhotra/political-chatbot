Resurrecting them could strengthen the villagers' position against the werewolves.", "speak": "Yes, I choose to resurrect Player3 because their insights might help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider who to save or eliminate if I want to protect the villagers while remaining undetected as the witch.", "speak": "I think it\u2019s essential to discuss our suspicions in detail. There must be clues we are missing that could lead us to the werewolves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to gather more information on who appears suspicious among the players. Based on our discussions, Player2 seems to be hiding something, and their actions could signal they might be one of the werewolves. It's safer to vote for Player2.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to make a careful decision on whether to eliminate a player or to save someone, depending on the dynamics of the game. I haven't heard any strong suspicions thrown towards the werewolves yet, so it might be wise to wait for more information before taking a drastic action.", "speak": "I'm still processing everything that's been said. Who do you all suspect might be one of the werewolves?", "eliminate": false}

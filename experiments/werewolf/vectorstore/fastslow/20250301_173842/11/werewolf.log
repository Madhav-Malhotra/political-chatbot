Player1: {"thought": "Now that Player3 is out, we have fewer players to analyze. I need to pay close attention to Player2 and Player4 to see if any of them slip up or seem overly defensive. I'll suggest we focus our discussion on them.", "speak": "With Player3 gone, let's keep an eye on Player2 and Player4. What do you guys think of their behavior?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I suspect Player2 might be the werewolf based on their behavior during discussions. Player4 hasn't shown any particularly suspicious actions. I feel confident in my assessment.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": "0.2"}

Player3: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their previous behavior. I want to check their identity to gather more information for the team.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I find it concerning that Player2 is questioning Player3. Player1 is already known to be a werewolf, so the focus should be on eliminating them rather than doubting Player3, who has valuable information as the seer. The villagers need to rally together to point out Player1.", "speak": "I believe we should focus on Player1, as we know they're a werewolf. It's crucial we work together to eliminate them."}

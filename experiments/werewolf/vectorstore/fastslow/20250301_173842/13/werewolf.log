Player1: {"thought": "I need to strategize and figure out who the werewolves are without revealing my identity.

Player1: {"thought": "I need to eliminate a player without raising suspicion towards myself. Right now, there's not enough information to confidently identify the other werewolf. I should consider voting for someone who is not too obviously a villager based on limited interactions so far.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": "0.7"}
Player1: {"thought": "With Player3 out of the game, I need to carefully consider who to target next. I still have to maintain my cover, so it's important to evaluate Player2 and Player4's actions and statements.", "speak": "Now that Player3 is gone, I think we should evaluate who could be the next potential target. What do you think about Player2 and Player4? Any suspicions?"}
Player1: {"thought": "Based on the previous vote and current players, I want to deflect suspicion and make a choice that seems reasonable. Player2 hasn't been very vocal or forthcoming, which might suggest they have something to hide. The uncertainty remains because voluntary and involuntary quietness can be misinterpreted.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.6}

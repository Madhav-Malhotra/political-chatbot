Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to maintain my cover as the Seer while also guiding the villagers to focus on Player1, who is actually a werewolf. I have to ensure that I build trust with the other players while still being strategic about conveying my suspicions.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. It's important to share our thoughts about each player. I have a strong suspicion about Player1, and I think we should keep an eye on them."}

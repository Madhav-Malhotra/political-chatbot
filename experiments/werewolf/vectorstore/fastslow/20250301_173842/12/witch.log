Player4: {"thought": "Player2 might be a villager, and if we don't take action, we risk losing another villager. Resurrecting them could help us gather more information during the day phase and potentially identify werewolves.", "speak": "Yes, I want to resurrect Player2. I believe it's crucial to maintain our numbers and gather more insights.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be trying to deflect attention onto Player1, which is suspicious. I need to consider if they might be a werewolf trying to mislead us.", "speak": "I understand your concern about Player1, but we should also be cautious of how we handle accusations. We need solid reasoning behind our decisions."}

However, we don't know their role yet and I need to be strategic about when to use my powers. Resurrecting them might be helpful if they're a valuable role, but it could also reveal that I'm the witch who saved them.", "speak": "I am considering resurrecting Player2 because if they hold a key role like the Seer or if they are a villager, their insights could aid us in identifying the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious as we discuss Player1. I have the ability to resurrect Player2, which could significantly influence the group's strategy, but I must first gauge the conversation around Player1's potential role more thoroughly.", "speak": "Let's keep discussing Player1. What are your thoughts on their behavior? Any suspicions?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I have been observing the behaviors of the other players, and Player3 seems to be a bit evasive in their discussions. They haven't provided much insight, which raises my suspicion. However, without any clear evidence, I'm somewhat uncertain about this vote.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

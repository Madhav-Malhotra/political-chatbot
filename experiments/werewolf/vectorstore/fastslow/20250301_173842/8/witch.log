Resurrecting Player2 may help gather more information and potentially reveal a werewolf.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because keeping more players alive can facilitate discussions and might uncover the identity of the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems suspicious of Player1, which could indicate they are trying to distract us from suspecting each other. We need to stay vigilant and not turn against each other too quickly.", "speak": "I agree with Player3 about the need to talk more about Player1. Let\u2019s not let suspicion drive us apart, but let's be careful of who we trust."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider who is more likely to be a werewolf. Player1 has been quite vocal in discussions but hasn't provided solid arguments against Player3. I suspect Player1 might be hiding something. However, I'm still unsure if it's a good idea to eliminate them right now. I'm leaning towards Player1, but I'll need to keep evaluating the game dynamics.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

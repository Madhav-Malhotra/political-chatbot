Player1: {"thought": "Player2's quietness is suspicious, and they haven't defended themselves much. However, this could be a tactic to draw attention away from themselves or simply their strategy to avoid unnecessary suspicion.

Player1: {"thought": "I need to remain cautious and observe how others respond to the suspicion on Player2. My strategy should focus on blending in and guiding the discussion to gather more information while keeping my role hidden.", "speak": "I still think Player2 is acting suspiciously.

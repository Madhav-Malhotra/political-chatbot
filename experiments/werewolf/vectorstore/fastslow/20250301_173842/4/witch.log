Player4: {"thought": "I still suspect Player3 might be a villager or have a special role since they were targeted by the werewolves. Right now, I think it's best not to eliminate anyone tonight and gather more information during the day phase. This will help us decide our strategy more effectively.", "speak": "I don't think we should eliminate anyone tonight. Let's keep our options open and see how the discussion unfolds during the day phase.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious while discussing suspicions. If Player1 is unsure about Player4, I should consider how to use this to our advantage. I need to clarify where everyone stands and gauge Player1's suspicions to draw out more information.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1. Let's reconsider our suspicions about Player4. What specific behaviors have you noticed that make you question them?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I'm still uncertain about who to vote for. Player1 and Player2 could both potentially be werewolves, but I have no concrete evidence against either of them. Since Player3 is already out, I need to decide carefully to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.7}

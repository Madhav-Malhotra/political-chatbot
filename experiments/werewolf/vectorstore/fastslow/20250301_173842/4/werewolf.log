Player1: {"thought": "During the discussions, I've noticed Player3 has been quite quiet, which could mean they are trying to avoid drawing attention. This could be indicative of a hidden agenda. However, they're not the only quiet one, and without more concrete evidence, this is somewhat a shot in the dark.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.7}
Player1: {"thought": "With Player3 eliminated, I need to carefully analyze Player2 and Player4's reactions. It's crucial to gauge their suspicions and see if they align with my own views, helping me create a solid strategy. I must remain cautious and avoid giving away my identity as well.", "speak": "Now that Player3 is out, I think we should focus on who has been the most vocal and what their motivations might be. Do you both have any suspicions about Player2 or Player4?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I have observed that Player2 has been subtly dodging direct accusations and trying to redirect the suspicion onto others without providing concrete evidence. This makes me suspect that they might be trying to protect themselves at all costs. Player4, on the other hand, has been relatively consistent, although I need to be cautious about potentially underestimating them. Player2's behavior has been more suspicious to me in this aspect. However, I also have to be careful since I don't have complete information.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

Player4: {"thought": "I need to think strategically about whether saving Player3 is beneficial or not. If Player3 could potentially be a villager, their elimination would be detrimental to our chances of finding the werewolves. However, if I suspect they are one of the werewolves, it might be better to let them go.", "speak": "I think we should let Player3 stay eliminated for now, as their behavior has been suspicious. We can focus on identifying the werewolves instead.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I still feel suspicious about Player3's behavior, and if we don't act, we may lose an opportunity to identify the werewolves. However, I need to be cautious about my next move. It's also crucial to consider how the others perceive this situation.", "speak": "I still think Player3 seems suspicious, and it might be worth considering their elimination. Let's discuss our suspicions further.", "eliminate": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to shift the suspicion away from themselves and redirect it towards me. I need to maintain my stance and reveal that I suspect Player1 as well, to keep the attention off myself as the witch.", "speak": "I can understand your concerns, Player2, but let\u2019s not forget that Player1 also hasn't said much. We might want to keep an eye on them, too."}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe we need to eliminate Player1 or Player2, as Player3 is already out of the game. Since I find Player2 potentially more suspicious in this situation, I'll vote for them.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

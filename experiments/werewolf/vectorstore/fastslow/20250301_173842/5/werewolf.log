Given the lack of strong evidence, I'm not overly confident in this vote, but we need to make a move.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.7}
Player1: {"thought": "With Player3 gone, I need to assess the behavior of Player2 and Player4 more closely. There could still be a werewolf among us, and I should be strategic about my next move.", "speak": "Now that Player3 is out, I suggest we keep a close eye on Player2 and Player4. What are your thoughts on their actions so far?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I am leaning towards voting for Player2 because Player3, who was eliminated, did not give us a clear indication if they were a werewolf. This means there's still one more potential werewolf among us. Player4 has not raised any alarms yet, and I have a hunch about Player2 perhaps being the werewolf based on their behavior during our discussions.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": "0.6"}

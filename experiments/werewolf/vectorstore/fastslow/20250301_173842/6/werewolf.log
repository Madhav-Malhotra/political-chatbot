Player1: {"thought": "Now that Player3 is out of the game, I need to focus on managing the suspicions of Player2 and Player4. I should maintain a cooperative stance while subtly leading them to suspect each other.", "speak": "With Player3 gone, it clears up some confusion, but we still need to be cautious. I've noticed some odd behavior from Player2 as well. What do you think about their comments earlier?"}
Player1: {"thought": "With Player3 gone and only Player2 and Player4 left, I need to vote strategically. Player2 has been acting somewhat suspiciously based on previous observations. I will vote for Player2 to be eliminated, hoping that Player4 also sees this as the best option.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

I suspect Player2 might be hiding something based on their earlier comments, but I have to be careful about how I approach this.

Player2, you mentioned earlier that you have some thoughts. Let's hear what you think about the roles we each might have. This could help us narrow down who the werewolves are.", "finish_discussion": "false"}

I want to keep the suspicion on them, although there's still uncertainty as the game is early, and I have limited information.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.6}
Player1: {"thought": "Now that Player2 is out of the game, I need to reassess my strategy. I wonder if Player3 or Player4 might suspect me. I should focus on gathering information while keeping my identity hidden. I need to steer the discussion in a way that keeps suspicion away from me and towards others.", "speak": "With Player2 gone, we should share our thoughts on who we suspect might be the remaining werewolf. Player3, do you have any insights or feelings about Player4's actions during our discussions?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I suspect Player4 due to their silent behavior during discussions. It's possible they're trying to stay under the radar, which is a common tactic for a werewolf. I want to cast my vote on Player4 to see how Player3 reacts and to gauge any potential alliances or suspicions.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

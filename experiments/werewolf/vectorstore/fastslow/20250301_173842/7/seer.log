Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather valuable information that can help the villagers identify the werewolves. I think I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I should reveal that I know Player1 is a werewolf, but I need to be cautious about how I approach this conversation. I must encourage suspicion towards Player4 while still providing evidence of Player1's guilt.", "speak": "I believe we should focus on eliminating Player1. I checked them last night and learned that they are a werewolf."}

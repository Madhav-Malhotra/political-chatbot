Player4: {"thought": "I need to observe the dynamics between the remaining players and gather more information before making any elimination. It\u2019s too early to decide who to target, as we have no evidence of who the werewolves could be yet.", "speak": "I believe we should hold off on eliminating anyone for now. Let's discuss our suspicions and see what everyone else thinks.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to defend my position and gather more information before making any accusations. It's important to keep the discussion civil and focused on the facts.", "speak": "I understand your concerns about me, Player3. However, we need to focus on gathering evidence and making informed decisions. Let's share our thoughts and see if we can identify any true signs of the werewolves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider who might be a werewolf between Player1 and Player3. I've been trying to gather information, and Player1 seems to be quieter during discussions. While Player3 is more vocal, they could also be trying to divert attention. I need to make a strategic vote based on this.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather some information to help the villagers identify the werewolves. I'll check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious. Player1 is already known to be a werewolf, and I must ensure Player4 doesn't suspect me of knowing that. I should steer the conversation and create a reason to eliminate Player4, even if it's just to gather more information.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. We should definitely be vigilant about Player4. I feel like they could be hiding something."}

Eliminating now could be premature, but I have to keep an eye on their reactions and suspicions. I need to tread carefully and not make any drastic moves yet.", "speak": "I think we should take some time to discuss our suspicions before rushing to a decision about who to eliminate.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to maintain my cover as a villager while listening closely to the others' insights and accusations. I still haven\u2019t revealed my role as a witch, which could be crucial if we are close to eliminating a player who might not be a werewolf. I need to assess who seems more suspicious based on their reactions and reasoning.", "speak": "I feel like Player1 and Player2 both have valid points, but we should be careful and not jump to conclusions. It might help to hear everyone's thoughts on what we should do next."}
Player4: {"thought": "I feel uncertain about who the werewolf might be between Player1 and Player2. I haven't gathered enough evidence to make a definitive decision. Both seem suspicious in their own ways. I think I will vote for Player2, but I'm not fully confident in this choice.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.7}

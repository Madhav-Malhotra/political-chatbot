Player1: {"thought": "Based on the limited interaction so far, I'm suspicious of Player2 because they seem to be deflecting more than engaging in finding werewolves. However, I'm not entirely sure of their role yet.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.7}
Player1: {"thought": "I'm still feeling uncertain about Player2, but I need to listen to what others say in this discussion. I might need to adjust my strategy based on their responses.", "speak": "Let's keep our focus on Player2 for now, but I'm interested to hear more thoughts on Player4 as well."}
Player1: {"thought": "Given the game dynamics, I still feel Player2 has been evasive in our discussions, which makes me suspicious. I also need to pay attention to behavioral changes in others, especially as the rounds progress. Therefore, I'm voting for Player2 again.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.6}

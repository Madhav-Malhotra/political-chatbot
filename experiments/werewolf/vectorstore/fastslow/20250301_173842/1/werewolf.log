Player1: {"thought": "I need to assess the players' reactions and statements to identify who could be the werewolves. Trust is crucial here, especially since I don't want to reveal my role too early. It's also important to gauge whether I can align with anyone to protect my identity.", "speak": "I think we should be cautious in our discussions. We know that two players are werewolves among us.

Player1: {"thought": "Given there has only been limited discussion so far and no one has been eliminated yet, I don't have concrete evidence to confidently vote for someone. However, I want to make a choice that can provide more information. So, I'll vote for Player3 who has been relatively quiet and whose actions I find suspicious. My uncertainty is high since I don't have a lot of information yet.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.8}
Player1: {"thought": "With Player3 eliminated, I need to analyze the reactions from Player2 and Player4. Their responses will give me insight into their thought processes and whether they could be werewolves. I must remain cautious and not reveal too much about my own role yet.", "speak": "Now that we have eliminated Player3, let's discuss what we can infer from this situation. Player2, what's your take on how that vote went? And Player4, do you have any thoughts on who the remaining werewolf might be?"}
Player1: {"thought": "Based on the conversations and eliminations so far, I suspect Player2 might be a werewolf. Their responses during discussions seemed calculated, and I want to see how Player4 reacts to this vote.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

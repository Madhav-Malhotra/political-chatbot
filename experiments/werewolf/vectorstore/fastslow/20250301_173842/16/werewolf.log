Player1: {"thought": "I'm trying to steer the suspicion onto someone else by seeing if others agree with my concern about Player3. If I can steer the conversation naturally, it might make Player3 seem more suspicious to others.

Player1: {"thought": "I need to stay focused on guiding the conversation away from myself while also keeping an eye on Player2 and Player4's reactions to the accusations against Player3. I want to see if they might also be potential werewolves.", "speak": "Since we're discussing Player3, I also have my doubts about Player2. How do the rest of you feel about their behavior during our discussions?"}

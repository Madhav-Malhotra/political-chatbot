Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to use my powers wisely. If Player3 was eliminated tonight, they might have some important information or they could be a location of the Seer or Villager. I want to keep the game at a standstill, while gathering more information.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player3 because I believe they may have valuable insights that can help us identify the werewolves, and I want to keep the player count equal between villagers and werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It seems like Player3 is trying to shift the blame onto Player1, which might be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves. I need to be cautious and gather more information before taking any action.", "speak": "Player3, that's a bold claim! Do you have any evidence or reasons why you believe Player1 is a werewolf?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I still find Player3 suspicious for trying to deflect blame onto Player1. It could be a tactic to cover up their role as a werewolf. However, I need to consider if there might be additional motives behind Player3's actions. I will vote for Player3 this round to test my theory.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}

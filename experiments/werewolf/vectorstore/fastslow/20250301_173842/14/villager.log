I should listen closely to Player1 and Player4's insights and see if they align or seem suspicious.", "speak": "I agree, it's important to analyze Player1's and Player4's reactions. I don't have any strong suspicions at the moment, but I'm open to hearing what you both think."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have no strong suspicions, but I feel that Player4's behavior has been a bit off. However, I don't have enough evidence to be completely sure, and Player1 hasn't stood out as suspicious either. It's a tough decision.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.6}

Player1: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in my decision since we have very limited information. Player2 has been a bit quiet and less engaged, which often is a werewolf's strategy to avoid suspicion. However, without solid evidence, this is still uncertain.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": "0.6"}

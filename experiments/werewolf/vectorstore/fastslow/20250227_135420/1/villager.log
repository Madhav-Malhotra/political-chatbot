Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems to be encouraging discussion, which is good for the villagers, but I need to remain cautious about everyone's motives. It's still early, and we have to be careful who we trust. I want to see if Player3 or Player4 might have any insights or suspicions as well.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. Sharing our thoughts could help us figure out who might be the werewolves. Player3, Player4, what do you think? Do you have any suspicions yet?"}

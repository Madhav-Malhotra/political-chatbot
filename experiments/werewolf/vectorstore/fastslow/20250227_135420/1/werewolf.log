Player1: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about the conversations and try to gauge the intentions of Player2, Player3, and Player4. I have to blend in with the villagers while subtly steering the conversation. Since there are two werewolves, I should also think strategically about the votes and potential alliances.", "speak": "I've been thinking about how we can figure out who the werewolves are. Maybe we should share our suspicions and see if anyone's behavior stands out."}
Player1: {"thought": "I suspect Player3 based on their earlier behavior and reactions during discussions. They seemed too eager to deflect suspicion and avoid accountability, which is often a tactic of werewolves.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": "0.2"}

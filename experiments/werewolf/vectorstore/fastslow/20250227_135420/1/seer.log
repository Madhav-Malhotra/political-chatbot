Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information to determine who the werewolves are. I want to check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or a villager.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to stay cautious as a seer and not reveal my role. I should observe how Player1 and Player2 interact with Player4 since their opinions could be telling.", "speak": "I think it's too early to point fingers just yet. Maybe we should discuss some behaviors we've noticed. Player4, do you have any insights?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I believe Player1 is acting suspiciously based on their comments during the discussions. They haven't contributed much to identify the werewolves and seem to avoid directing attention towards themselves.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}

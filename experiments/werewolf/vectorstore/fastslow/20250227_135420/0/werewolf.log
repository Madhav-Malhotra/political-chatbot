Player1: {"thought": "I need to strategize my moves carefully now that there are four players in the game. I must try to observe the behavior of others and figure out who seems suspicious without drawing too much attention to myself. I will focus on subtly directing suspicion towards Player2 while keeping my identity hidden as a werewolf.", "speak": "I've been thinking about how we should approach this. Player2 seems a bit off to me. What do you all think about their actions during the last round?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to eliminate a player who seems suspicious and could potentially be a werewolf. Based on the previous discussions, Player3 has been acting a bit defensively and hasn't contributed much to identifying the werewolves. My gut feeling tells me Player3 is a higher risk.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": "0.2"}

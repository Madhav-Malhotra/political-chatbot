Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful about how I present myself. If I come off too defensive, they might suspect I'm the witch or worse, a werewolf. I should try to blend in with the villagers and guide the conversation subtly.", "speak": "I agree, it\u2019s important to stay open-minded. We should gather more evidence before making any assumptions. How about we each share any observations we\u2019ve made about each player?"}

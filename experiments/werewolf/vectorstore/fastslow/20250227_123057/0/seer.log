Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather crucial information to protect the villagers. I suspect Player4 might be a werewolf based on their previous comments, so I will check Player4's role.", "speak": "Player4"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player4 is a witch.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information before revealing my role as the seer. My insights could turn the tide, but I must remain cautious in this discussion to avoid drawing attention to myself.", "speak": "I think we should keep our eyes on how Player4 is participating. Their responses seem a bit vague, and it might be worth considering their involvement when we vote."}
Player3: {"thought": "I'm considering that Player1 has been acting suspiciously and has not been contributing much to the discussions. I might have a clearer picture of who the werewolves are, but I need to be cautious as I could be targeting a villager instead.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0.4"}

Player2: {"thought": "I need to gather information and see if anyone has any clues about Player4's behavior since they're the only other player left with me.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. I've also found Player4's actions a bit suspicious. Did you notice anything unusual about their behavior last night?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I am leaning towards voting for Player4 because their behavior seems more suspicious compared to Player1. Given that Player3 is already dead, we need to focus on identifying the remaining werewolf. I feel somewhat certain about my decision based on the observations I've made during the discussions.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

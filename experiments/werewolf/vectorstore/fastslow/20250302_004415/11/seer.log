Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information early on to help the villagers. I'm considering checking Player1 tonight, as they seem to have a neutral stance in the discussions so far.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "It's essential that I share my thoughts while also keeping my role as a seer concealed. Player2 seems to be wary but not overly suspecting anyone just yet. I will try to steer the conversation without revealing too much.", "speak": "I think we need to share our observations about each other more. What do you think about Player4's actions during the last discussion?"}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I know Player1 is a werewolf, my focus should be on eliminating them. However, I need to be careful about how I approach this vote to prevent raising suspicion towards myself. I will vote for Player1, which seems the logical choice based on my knowledge.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

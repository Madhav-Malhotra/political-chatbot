Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have a valuable opportunity here. Reviving Player3 could provide us with more information about the game, especially if they are not a werewolf. However, I also need to consider the risk of revealing my identity by resurrecting a player. If Player3 holds information that could help us catch the werewolves, it may be worth the risk.", "speak": "I believe I should resurrect Player3. They might have crucial information that can help us in our discussions against Player1 and Player2. It's important for the villagers to have as much information as possible to identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I should maintain my role as the witch without revealing too much. It's important to keep my actions subtle and use them strategically. I hope Player3 can provide valuable insight, and I need to advocate for building consensus against the werewolves while not drawing attention to myself.", "speak": "I think we should focus on discussing our observations from previous nights. Player1 and Player2, what stood out to you about each other's behavior?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I think Player1's behavior seems a bit suspicious, but I still need more clarity from Player2 and Player3's observations before making a definitive vote. I will vote for Player1 to see the reactions it gets.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0.4"}

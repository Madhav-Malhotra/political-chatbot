Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is raising suspicions about Player1, which could either be a strategic move if Player3 is a werewolf or genuine concern if they are a villager. I should gauge Player2's reaction and consider how to approach this conversation without revealing my role as a witch.", "speak": "I agree that we should carefully consider Player1's actions. We need to gather as much information as possible before making any decisions."}
Player4: {"thought": "I still have some uncertainty about Player1, especially since Player3 has been vocal about them. However, I also need to consider that Player3 could be trying to divert attention. I'll vote for Player3 as they have been suspecting Player1 without solid evidence, which feels a bit manipulative to me.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}
Player4: {"thought": "With only three of us left, tensions are high. I need to be cautious about my next move. Player1 and Player2 might have formed an alliance against me, given that Player3 is dead. I should try to figure out more about their intentions before deciding to eliminate anyone. I want to ensure I'm using my abilities strategically as the witch.", "speak": "I think we should take a moment to think this through. It\u2019s critical that we don\u2019t rush our decision.

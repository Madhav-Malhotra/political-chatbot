Player4: {"thought": "I need to think strategically since Player2 is eliminated. Resurrecting them could potentially give us important insights, especially if they have a special role, but I need to assess the situation.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because having another player alive could provide us with more information on the roles and we might have a better chance of identifying the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to navigate this discussion carefully to ensure we target the actual werewolves and avoid making mistakes. Player1's accusation could be a tactic to divert attention.", "speak": "I think we should take a closer look at Player1's behavior. If Player3 is accusing Player1, we might need to emphasize that suspicion and see if Player1 can defend themselves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I still suspect Player1 due to their defensive behavior when accused. They might be trying to divert attention from their true role. Player3 seems to be quite vocal about this suspicion, which adds more weight to the argument against Player1.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.2}

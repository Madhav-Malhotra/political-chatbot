Player4: {"thought": "I need to think strategically about the potential outcomes. Player2's elimination could be crucial, and if they are a villager, reviving them could help gather more information to identify the werewolves. However, if they are a werewolf, reviving them would be detrimental.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player2 since I need to assess who the werewolves are first before using my potion.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to tread carefully here. Since I'm playing as the witch, I don't want to reveal my role or intentions too quickly. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their previous behavior, but I need more evidence. I will hold off on eliminating anyone for now and gather more information during the discussion phase.", "speak": "I think it would be wise to hold off on any eliminations for now. We should discuss more to gather information before making a decision.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic here. Player3 seems to be confident in their accusation against Player1, but I want to verify the trustworthiness of both players before making a decision. It's important to play my role as the witch wisely and not rush into eliminating someone prematurely.", "speak": "I see where you're coming from, Player3, but I think it's important to gather more evidence before making any decisions. What specific behaviors from Player1 make you think they're a werewolf?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I still have suspicions about Player1 based on their previous behavior, but I'm not entirely certain. Player3 hasn't given me enough information to justify a vote against them. I need to take a chance here to sway the game's direction while still being cautious of how to use my witch abilities later.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to defend myself and try to redirect the suspicion back to Player1. I should point out that they are a werewolf to persuade others to see my point of view.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, but I believe we should be more cautious with our accusations. Remember, Player1 has been identified as a werewolf, and we need to focus on eliminating them rather than turning on each other."}

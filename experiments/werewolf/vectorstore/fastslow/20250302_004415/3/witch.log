However, I must consider if Player2 could be a werewolf or not.

Player4: {"thought": "Player3 just revealed they checked Player1 and found them to be a werewolf. This adds more weight to the claim and puts us in a strong position to possibly eliminate Player1. I should be cautious and try to rally support for voting against Player1.", "speak": "If Player3 is telling the truth about Player1 being a werewolf, we have to vote to eliminate Player1. This could be our chance to reduce the werewolf threat."}

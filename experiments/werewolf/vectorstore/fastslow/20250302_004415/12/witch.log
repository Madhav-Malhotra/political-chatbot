Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to think carefully about my actions. Resurrecting Player2 could provide valuable information if they have a special role, but we also have to consider if they might be a werewolf. However, if Player2 is a villager, bringing them back could help us in identifying the werewolves. I believe there's more value in resurrecting them for now.", "speak": "Yes, I want to resurrect Player2 because they might have important information and could help the villagers in determining who the werewolves are.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I sense some suspicion towards Player1, but I want to gather more insights from Player2 and Player3 before making any conclusions. It's crucial to keep the discussion open and collaborative as a witch.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Let's hear what Player2 has to say, as they might have valuable insights."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to decide who might be a werewolf. Currently, I feel unsure about Player1 and Player3, but Player2 has been revived, so there's a chance they're a villager. I will vote to eliminate Player1, as I believe their actions may not align with the villagers' interests.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

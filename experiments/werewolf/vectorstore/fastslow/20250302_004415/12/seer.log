Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information to identify the werewolves. I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or a villager.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to play it carefully. I can't reveal that I know Player1 is a werewolf just yet, as that could put me in danger. I should try to gather more information from Player2 and Player4.", "speak": "I think we need to keep an eye on Player1, but I'd like to hear more from Player2 and Player4 first."}
Player3: {"thought": "I know Player1 is a werewolf since I learned their role, so I need to vote for them to eliminate a werewolf.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

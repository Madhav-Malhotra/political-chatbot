Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help identify the werewolves. I'll check Player1 tonight to see their role.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious how I approach this. Player1 has been revealed as a werewolf, and I should guide the conversation to ensure we eliminate them without revealing my role.", "speak": "I think it's important to point out that Player1 has been quick to redirect suspicion to others. We should focus on what they've done rather than getting sidetracked."}
Player3: {"thought": "With Player1 being confirmed as a werewolf, I am confident that we need to eliminate them. Player2 and Player4 have not given me any reason to suspect them yet, so my focus is solely on Player1.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to check Player2 tonight to gather some information about their role and help guide the villagers in the right direction.", "speak": "Player2"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player2 is a villager.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to navigate this conversation carefully, as Player2 is confirmed as a villager. It's important to steer the discussion towards Player4 without revealing my role yet.", "speak": "I think it's important that we also assess Player4's actions. How do you feel about their contributions so far?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I believe Player4 has been less forthcoming in our discussions, and their contributions seem suspicious to me. It's important to act on this suspicion while being cautious about how it may affect the villagers' perception of me.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

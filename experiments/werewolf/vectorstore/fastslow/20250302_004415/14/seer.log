Player3: {"thought": "I should check Player1 tonight to gather information about their role. It's important to figure out if they're werewolf or villager, as this will guide our decisions in the upcoming day phase.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to play it carefully and sow doubt among the other players while subtly guiding them towards realizing that Player1 is a werewolf. It's important to share my insight without revealing my role as the Seer.", "speak": "I agree, Player2, but we should also consider what Player1 has said and done. Was there anything that stood out to anyone during our discussions?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I have confirmed that Player1 is a werewolf, and we must focus on eliminating them to secure the safety of the villagers. The other players should trust my insight as I guide the vote toward Player1.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0"}

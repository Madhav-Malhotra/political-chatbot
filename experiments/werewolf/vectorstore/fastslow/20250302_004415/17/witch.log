Player4: {"thought": "With the uncertainties of who might be a werewolf among the living players, I need to gather more information during the day phase before making an elimination choice.

I will not eliminate anyone right now.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be suspicious of Player2's elimination, which may indicate they are trying to deflect attention. I should keep an eye on their behavior and statements as we continue our discussion.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. We need to identify who might be the threats among us. Let's share our suspicions and observations."}
Player4: {"thought": "I'm still unsure about who among Player1 and Player3 could potentially be a werewolf. However, I have a stronger suspicion about Player1's potential deception than Player3.

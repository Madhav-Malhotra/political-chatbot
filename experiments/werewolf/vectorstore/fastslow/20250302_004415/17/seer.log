Player3: {"thought": "I need to check who Player1 is since they might pose a threat to the villagers.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful about revealing too much. I already know Player1 is a werewolf, and pointing that out too soon could make me a target. I should navigate the conversation to gather more information without exposing myself.", "speak": "I think Player2's elimination was surprising. They seemed to be a logical target for the werewolves. We should be cautious in our discussions and focus on who might be next."}
Player3: {"thought": "I know Player1 is a werewolf, and I need to make sure they are eliminated. Player4 hasn't shown any suspicious behavior, but Player1 is a clear threat. I need to stay focused and ensure the villagers have a chance to win.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0"}

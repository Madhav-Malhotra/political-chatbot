Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information that can help us identify the werewolves. I'm considering checking Player1 or Player2, as they seem to have varying levels of engagement in the discussions. However, I will pick Player1 for now since I want to see if they might be a werewolf.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to keep the information about Player1 being a werewolf secret for now. I should continue to observe Player2 and Player4's behavior to gather more information and potentially protect the villagers.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. Let's analyze everyone's behavior closely, especially today."}
Player3: {"thought": "I know Player1 is a werewolf, so it's crucial for the villagers to eliminate them. We need to ensure we vote wisely to confirm their elimination.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

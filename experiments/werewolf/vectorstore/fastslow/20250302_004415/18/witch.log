Player4: {"thought": "Since Player2 was eliminated tonight, it's a critical moment for us. I must consider if protecting Player2 will benefit me and the villagers, or if I should let them remain dead to stir suspicion and possibly find out who the werewolves are. However, Player2's insights could still be valuable in our discussions going forward. Resurrecting them might bring clarity to the situation.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2, as their presence could help us gather more information and clarify suspicions that have arisen during our discussions.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's important to gauge how Player2 will influence the discussion now that they're back in the game. I should be cautious in how I respond to player accusations and keep my role as the witch under wraps for now while focusing on teamwork with the villagers.", "speak": "I believe we should discuss our suspicions openly. Player2, now that you\u2019re back, what do you think about Player1 and Player3's behavior in the last round?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and consider who is likely to be a werewolf among the players. Player1 and Player3 have both been quite outspoken, and while that could indicate they are trying to protect themselves, it doesn't necessarily mean they are werewolves. I suspect Player3 might be more of a threat due to their quietness during previous rounds. I will vote for Player3. However, I still have some doubts about Player1, so my certainty isn't absolute.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}
Player4: {"thought": "Now that Player2 has been resurrected, we have a chance to gather more information. Player1 and Player2 should discuss the suspicions they have about Player3's elimination. I believe it\u2019s best to observe for now, as eliminating a player at this stage could backfire and create suspicion on me as the witch.", "speak": "I think we need to focus on discussing what we know about Player3's elimination and any suspicions that have arisen. Let's work together to figure out who the werewolves might be.", "eliminate": false}

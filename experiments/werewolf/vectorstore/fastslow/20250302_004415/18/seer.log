Player3: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in my choice since I can gather crucial information about either a werewolf or a villager. I suspect that Player1 has been acting suspiciously, so I will check Player1 tonight to see their true role.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful with my words as I already know Player1's true role. I need to steer the conversation without revealing that I know Player1 is a werewolf. I will suggest investigating Player2 or Player4 further to gather more opinions.", "speak": "I think we should consider looking into Player2 and Player4's actions more closely. What do you all think?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I want to vote for Player1 since I know they are a werewolf, and we need to eliminate them to protect the villagers. However, I need to frame my arguments carefully to avoid drawing suspicion to myself.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

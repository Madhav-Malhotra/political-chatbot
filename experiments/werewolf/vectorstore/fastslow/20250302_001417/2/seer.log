Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information about someone's alignment to guide the villagers. I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to remain cautious about how I approach this, as Player1 is a known werewolf. I should deflect suspicion towards Player4 while preserving an air of neutrality.", "speak": "I think we should analyze Player4's voting behavior. It's important to understand where their loyalties lie, especially with Player2 eliminated."}
Player3: {"thought": "I am confident that Player1 is a werewolf based on my role as the seer and the information I have gathered. Voting for Player1 would help eliminate the threat to the villagers.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

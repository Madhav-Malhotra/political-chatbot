Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help the villagers identify the werewolves. I'll check one of the players to gather intelligence. I will check Player1 tonight, as they seem to be a potential candidate for being a werewolf based on their behavior so far.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to carefully decide how to convey the information I have about Player1 being a werewolf, without revealing my role too early. I should guide the discussion towards Player1 while ensuring no one suspects me yet.", "speak": "I find it interesting how Player1 has been acting. Maybe we should consider them as a potential suspect."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I already know that Player1 is a werewolf, I need to inform the other players and make sure they vote for Player1 to eliminate them. It's crucial to reveal this information cautiously during the discussion.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems to be targeting me without much evidence. I need to defend myself and shift the focus toward Player3 or Player4, as I believe one of them might be a werewolf.", "speak": "I understand that I might seem defensive, but I'm just trying to protect myself and figure out who among us is acting suspiciously. What do you all think about Player3 or Player4?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I still feel that Player3 or Player4 might be more suspicious than me, but I have to make a choice. Player1 is being quite adamant about targeting me, which feels unjustified. I think I will vote for Player3 based on some of their earlier comments.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

Player3: {"thought": "I should check Player2 to see if they might be a werewolf, as they seem to be playing very cautiously and I've noticed some strange behavior.", "speak": "Player2"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player2 is a villager.
Player3: {"thought": "Now that I know Player2 is a villager, I need to find out more about the remaining players, Player1 and Player4, to identify the werewolves.", "speak": "I believe Player1 and Player4 should be looked at closely. We need to analyze their actions and see if they exhibit signs of being werewolves."}
Player3: {"thought": "I'm still unsure about Player1 and Player4, but since Player2 has been confirmed as a villager, I'll lean towards eliminating one of them. I have some suspicion about Player4's behavior, so I will vote for Player4.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to find out if Player1 is a werewolf, as I already know Player2 is a villager. This information will help us narrow down our suspicions.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.

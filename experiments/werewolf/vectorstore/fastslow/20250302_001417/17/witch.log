Since Player3 was eliminated tonight, providing them the chance to come back could be beneficial for the villagers, especially if they have important information or a special role. However, we also need to think strategically about the remaining players and their roles. If I believe that resurrecting Player3 will help the villagers' chances of identifying the werewolves, I should do it.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player3 because they might have valuable information that can help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to back Player3 now that they have returned. We must work together and share any insights we have. I've already resurrected them, which is a strong move to help the villagers. It's important to keep the focus on identifying the werewolves and strategizing our next moves.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Let\u2019s analyze Player1 and Player2 thoroughly. We can compare notes and see if there are any inconsistencies in their actions."}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to check one of the players to gather information about their identity. I suspect either Player1 or Player4 might be a werewolf based on earlier discussions.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to keep my identity as the seer hidden while trying to convince Player4 to vote for Player1. It's critical to disclose who the werewolf is without revealing my role.", "speak": "I think it's essential to discuss our suspicions openly. I believe Player1 is a werewolf based on the information I've gathered."}
Player3: {"thought": "I feel confident that Player1 is the werewolf and we need to eliminate them to protect ourselves. I believe Player4 will agree if I present my case clearly.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0.1"}

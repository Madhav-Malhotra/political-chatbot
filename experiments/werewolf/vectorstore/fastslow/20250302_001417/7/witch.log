I need to assess who is more likely to be a werewolf and who is providing valuable information to the group.", "speak": "I'm choosing not to resurrect Player3 because we need to gather more information about the remaining players and Player3's role may not have been as critical as we thought.

Player1 hasn't given much information yet, so I need to probe them further.", "speak": "I appreciate your thoughts, Player2. I think we should also pay attention to how Player1 has been behaving throughout this discussion. Player1, what are your thoughts on Player3's elimination and who you suspect now?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I still have doubts about Player3, but they are already dead. Now we need to focus on Player1 and Player2. Player1 has been more vocal, but I'm not sure if that's a strategy to appear innocent. Player2 has been quieter, which raises my suspicion. I think I'm leaning towards Player2, but I'm a bit uncertain.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

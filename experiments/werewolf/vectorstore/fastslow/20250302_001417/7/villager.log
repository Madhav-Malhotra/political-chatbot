Since Player3 is out, I'm trying to figure out if Player1 or Player4 could be a werewolf based on their discussions last night.", "speak": "I agree, we need to be cautious. Player3 was a villager, so that puts more pressure on us. I think we should consider how Player1 and Player4 reacted to Player3's accusations. Anyone have specific observations?"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to check one of the players to gather information for the next day. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their behavior so far in the discussions. This will help us determine our next steps.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in this discussion. Player1 is already identified as a werewolf, so I should focus on convincing Player4 of this fact without revealing my role.", "speak": "I agree, Player1 has been acting suspiciously. We should keep a close eye on their next moves."}
Player3: {"thought": "I am certain that Player1 is a werewolf and needs to be eliminated to protect the villagers. Player4 seems to be on my side as well, so I will vote for Player1.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

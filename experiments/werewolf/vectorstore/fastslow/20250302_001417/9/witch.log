Player4: {"thought": "It seems like Player2 was eliminated, but this could be part of a larger strategy by the werewolves. Resurrecting Player2 could give us further insight into the situation, depending on their role.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player2 because having more players can aid in detecting the werewolves and provide crucial information.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's a good strategy to observe who defends Player1. This may help us narrow down the suspects more effectively. I also should be cautious about revealing too much about my role as the witch until it's strategic to do so.", "speak": "Definitely, keeping an eye on those who defend each other is key. We need to be strategic about who we vote for next."}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information that could help the villagers identify the werewolves. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their earlier comments, which seemed suspicious. I'll check Player1's role tonight.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to divert attention away from themselves by questioning my quietness, which could be a tactic to confuse the villagers. I need to defend my innocence while also trying to gather more input from Player4 about their thoughts on Player1.", "speak": "I believe I have valid suspicions about Player1, given that I received confirmation of their role as a werewolf. We should focus on eliminating them. Player4, do you have any thoughts on this?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I know that Player1 is a werewolf based on the information I gathered. Therefore, I must vote to eliminate Player1 to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

Let's discuss further before making any hasty votes."}
Player4: {"thought": "I still have doubts about Player3's claim regarding Player1 being a werewolf. However, given that Player2 is already dead and unable to provide insight, I need to lean towards voting out Player1 to eliminate potential threats. Player3 also seems to be active and engaged.

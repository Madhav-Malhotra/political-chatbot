Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful about how I reveal information regarding Player1's identity as a werewolf. I should guide the conversation while keeping my role hidden.", "speak": "Player2, I can understand your perspective. It\u2019s crucial for us to figure out who the werewolves are. What do you think about discussing Player4's behavior?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in my vote since Player1 is a werewolf. I want to bring attention to Player2 and sway the group to eliminate a potential threat. However, I also need to gauge Player4's reactions during the discussion.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

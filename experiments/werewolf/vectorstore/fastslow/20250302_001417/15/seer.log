Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to tread carefully as I reveal information. Player1 is a werewolf, and I must strategize to identify the other one. I should remain cautious about how I approach the conversation with Player4.", "speak": "I think we had to take action to reduce the threat. However, I feel uneasy about making decisions quickly. Player1, what was your reasoning behind voting for Player2?"}

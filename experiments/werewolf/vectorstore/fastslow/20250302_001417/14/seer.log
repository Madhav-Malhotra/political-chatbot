Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to shift focus away from Player1, but I already know Player1 is a werewolf. I need to guide the conversation towards revealing Player1's true nature without exposing myself as the seer.", "speak": "I see your point, Player2. It's important that we discuss everyone. Player1, can you tell us more about your thoughts on Player3 and Player4?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I am certain that Player1 is a werewolf since I have already seen their true identity. It's crucial to eliminate them to protect the villagers. I will advocate for Player1's elimination, even if others might be focused on different leads.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

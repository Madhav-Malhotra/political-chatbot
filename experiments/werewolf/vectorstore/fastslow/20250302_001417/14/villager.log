Player2: {"thought": "I need to keep an eye on Player3 and Player4 since they've been quiet. It could mean they are either trying to blend in as villagers or are indeed werewolves. I should suggest we discuss Player3's and Player4's behavior more openly.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. It's important we keep an eye on Player3 and Player4 since they've been a bit quieter than the rest of us. Perhaps we should discuss their actions more, to see if they give anything away."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have my suspicions about Player3 and Player4 due to their quiet behavior, but I feel like Player4 has been dodging questions more actively than Player3. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player4 this round.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}

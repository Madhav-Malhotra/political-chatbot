Their perspective could provide valuable information for our discussions.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I approach this discussion. I can't reveal my identity as the witch, but I have to support the idea of analyzing Player1's behavior without raising suspicion.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. It's important to look closely at Player1's actions. They could be playing a role that helps the werewolves. Let's discuss what we've observed."}

Additionally, it could create distrust among the werewolves, as they might not expect Player2 to come back.", "speak": "I will use my potion of life to resurrect Player2; we need their knowledge.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's essential to back Player3's claim and focus on eliminating Player1. This will help the villagers get closer to victory. I should also keep my witch role hidden for now to maintain my advantage.", "speak": "I agree with Player3; we should target Player1 based on the information that has been revealed. Let's vote to eliminate them."}

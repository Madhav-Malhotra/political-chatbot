Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to guide my team. I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or a villager.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal the information I have about Player1 while being cautious not to raise suspicion against myself as the Seer.", "speak": "I believe we should carefully consider our next move. I found out that Player1 is a werewolf. We need to strategize on how to approach a vote."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I should vote to eliminate them to protect the villagers and win the game. It's clear they pose a threat to us.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

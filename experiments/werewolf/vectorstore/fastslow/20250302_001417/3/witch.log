Player4: {"thought": "It's crucial to assess who the players are targeting and to identify any potential werewolves. Player2's vocal presence may need to be scrutinized further. However, eliminating anyone prematurely could backfire.

Player4: {"thought": "It's important to observe Player1's and Player3's discussions closely. Player1 seems to be trying to shift the focus away from themselves, which could be a sign of a werewolf. I need to be cautious about how I present myself so that I don't attract suspicion while still gathering information.", "speak": "I agree that analyzing Player3 and Player4's actions can provide insight into their possible roles. However, I think it's essential to also consider what motives might drive their suspicions."}
Player4: {"thought": "I'm still suspicious of Player1 based on their attempts to shift focus away from themselves. I believe eliminating them could help the villagers, as they might be a werewolf trying to deflect attention. Player3's behavior hasn't raised any red flags for me, making Player1 my top suspicion.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.2}

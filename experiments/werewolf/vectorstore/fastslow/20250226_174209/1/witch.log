I need to play my role wisely and keep my options open for the night phase, considering I have saving and killing abilities as the witch.", "speak": "That's a great idea, Player3. Analyzing the votes and the reasoning behind them can really help us identify any suspicious behavior. We should also keep in mind how everyone has been acting throughout the game."}

We need to discuss our suspicions openly to identify any werewolves among us.", "eliminate": false}

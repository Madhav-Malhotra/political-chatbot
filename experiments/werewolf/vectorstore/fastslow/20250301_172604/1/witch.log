Player4: {"thought": "I need to gauge the reactions of the other players during the day discussion to identify any suspicious behavior. Right now, it's too risky to use my potion of death, as it may backfire if I eliminate an innocent player.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to deflect suspicion while subtly gathering more information from Player2 about their thoughts on Player1 and myself.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player2. I'm just trying to assess the situation based on the actions of everyone. What do you think about Player1? Do you find their behavior suspicious?"}

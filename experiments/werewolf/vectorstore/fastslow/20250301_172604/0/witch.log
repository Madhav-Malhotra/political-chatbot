Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess the situation carefully. Since Player2 is a potential villager, resurrecting them could give us more insight during the day. However, we need to consider if they might be a threat if they were turned out to be a werewolf.", "speak": "I think I will resurrect Player2. It might give us a chance to gather more information about the roles of others as we discuss during the day.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation towards Player1 and gauge everyone's reaction. If Player3 is targeting Player1, I need to figure out if they are actually a villager or a werewolf trying to shift the blame.", "speak": "I've been observing Player1 as well. They seem a bit defensive in their arguments, which could be a sign of guilt. How do the rest of you feel about Player1's actions?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I still think Player1 is showing some defensive behavior that raises suspicion. We need to take concrete action to eliminate the werewolf threat. However, I remain a bit uncertain about whether Player2 or Player3 might also be involved, but Player1 seems like the best choice for now.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

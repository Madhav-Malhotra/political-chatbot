Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to make the villagers aware of Player1's true identity as a werewolf. I should be cautious in my approach to avoid revealing too much too soon, especially since players may doubt my role.", "speak": "I confirm that Player1 is indeed a werewolf. We must eliminate Player1 to protect ourselves."}

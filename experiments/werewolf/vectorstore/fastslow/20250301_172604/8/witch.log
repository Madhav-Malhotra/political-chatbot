Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to think strategically about the elimination. If Player4 is eliminated, that means I need to decide quickly whether to resurrect them or let them go. Resurrecting Player4 could give us another chance to find the werewolves, but I also need to consider the implications of this move on our overall strategy.", "speak": "I think we should resurrect Player4.

Player4: {"thought": "Player3 just called out Player1 as a werewolf. I need to be cautious and assess the others' reactions. It might be a strategy to deflect attention away from themselves or another player. I should weigh the evidence and remain neutral for now.", "speak": "Interesting accusation, Player3. How can you be so sure about Player1 being a werewolf?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I still need more information before I make a solid decision. Player3's accusation could be a diversion, but I also have to consider Player1's reaction. I'm leaning towards Player1 but not fully convinced yet.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

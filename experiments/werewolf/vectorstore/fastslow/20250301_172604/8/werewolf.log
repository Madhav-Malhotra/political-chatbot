Player1: {"thought": "I need to gauge the suspicions of the other players to better understand their perspectives and possibly identify the werewolves. I should subtly steer the conversation to see if any of them slip up or express doubts about each other.", "speak": "I think we should start by sharing who we suspect the werewolves might be.

Player1: {"thought": "As a werewolf, I should evaluate which player seems most at risk of realizing our identities or which one is throwing suspicion towards the werewolves. If they've voiced suspicions or showed analytical behavior, they might pose a threat. The uncertainty is not too high because creating chaos early might benefit us.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to make sure I can divert attention away from myself and my fellow werewolf. By eliminating a player who is suspicious but not revealing any new information, we can make our positions stronger.", "speak": "I really think Player4 has been acting a bit off. Has anyone else noticed that? Maybe we should focus on who we feel the least confident about."}
Player1: {"thought": "I believe that Player4's behavior is suspicious, and diverting attention towards them could help eliminate a potential threat while protecting my identity. It's a strategic move to strengthen my position and that of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.2}

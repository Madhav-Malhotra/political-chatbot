I need to stay observant and gather more information after that vote to see if any patterns or alliances start to form.", "speak": "I voted for Player3, but I'm curious to see how the rest of you feel about this. Player2, what's your take on Player3? And how do you feel about the current situation?"}
Player1: {"thought": "Observing Player3's behavior, I notice they haven't defended themselves or contributed effectively to the discussion which could be suspicious. Given my role as a werewolf, I want to ensure that suspicions are directed away from myself and my teammate. Voting for Player3 again keeps my behavior consistent.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

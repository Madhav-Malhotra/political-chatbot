Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have the power to save a player, which can significantly impact the game. I suspect Player3 might hold valuable information or be a villager.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to maintain a balanced perspective and not overly defend any specific player. It's essential to keep the conversation focused on gathering information about all players, including Player1 and Player3.", "speak": "I think it's important we consider our suspicions widely rather than narrowing it down too heavily on one player. Player1 has been acting a bit defensively, which could either be due to being a villager or hiding something."}

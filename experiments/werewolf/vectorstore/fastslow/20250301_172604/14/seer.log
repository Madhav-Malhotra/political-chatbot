Player3: {"thought": "I need to check one of the players to gather information about their roles. I'll check Player1 tonight to see if they're a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to maintain my cover as the Seer while subtly guiding the discussion. I want to hint at Player1's identity without revealing too much too soon.", "speak": "I find it interesting that Player1 is being so vocal. It makes me wonder if they\u2019re trying to divert attention away from themselves."}
Player3: {"thought": "I know that Player1 is a werewolf, so I need to vote to eliminate them. It's crucial for the villagers' survival.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}
Player3: {"thought": "I want to gather more information about Player4, as I already know Player1 is a werewolf. This could help me identify the last werewolf or the villagers' roles.", "speak": "Player4"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player4 is a witch.

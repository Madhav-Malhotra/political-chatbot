Player4: {"thought": "Tonight's elimination of Player3 seems suspicious. I need to think strategically about whether saving them would benefit the villagers or not. Since Player3 is still alive, they could provide valuable insights in the next round. However, if Player3 is indeed a villager, I need to ensure the survival of at least one villager. There's not enough information to ascertain the best move right now.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player3 because having them in the game could provide critical information for the villagers. Plus, eliminating them without knowing their role could be a big mistake.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player1 is raising suspicion towards me, which could indicate they are trying to deflect attention from themselves. I need to stay calm and present my case clearly. I should subtly defend my position while gathering more information about Player1 and Player2.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1, but I believe it's crucial to analyze everyone's behavior. I'm here to work together as a villager, and I'd like us to focus on identifying suspicious patterns from all players."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess who might be the werewolves among the players. Player1 and Player2 potentially seem less suspicious, but I don't have concrete evidence. I have to make a decision based on my gut feeling and the dynamics of the discussion we had. I vote for Player1 as I find their responses less trustworthy.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.7}

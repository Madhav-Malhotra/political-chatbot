Player1: {"thought": "I need to maintain my cover and keep the conversation focused on others while downplaying any suspicion on myself. I should also subtly steer the discussion away from Player3, since I've already voted for them, and encourage scrutiny on Player2 or Player4 instead.", "speak": "I've noticed that Player2 has been a bit quiet too. Maybe we should consider everyone's contributions before making a final decision on who to eliminate."}
Player1: {"thought": "I've been trying to deflect suspicion away from myself and encourage others to focus on Player2. They have been quiet and seem less involved in the discussions, which might make them a target for elimination. I feel relatively confident about this vote.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.2}

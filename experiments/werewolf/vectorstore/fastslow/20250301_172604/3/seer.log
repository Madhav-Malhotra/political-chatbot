Player3: {"thought": "I need to divert the attention away from myself and try to gauge how Player4 views Player1. I also need to hint at the concern I have about Player1 without revealing that I know their role. It's crucial to build trust with Player4.", "speak": "I think we need to be very careful with our suspicions. Player1's been quite quiet, and that can be a sign of a werewolf trying to blend in. Player4, what's your read on Player1?"}

I should maintain a strategic advantage and avoid drawing attention to myself as the witch.

We need to act cautiously now.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Player1 has been relatively quiet, which could be suspicious. We should discuss their behavior more closely to see if there are any signs that they might be a werewolf."}
Player4: {"thought": "I still believe Player1 is acting suspiciously, and it's crucial we eliminate them to protect the villagers. However, I'm a bit cautious since there are only three of us left.

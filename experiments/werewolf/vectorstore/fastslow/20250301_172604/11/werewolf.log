Player1: {"thought": "I need to ensure that we, the werewolves, eliminate a villager, but it's crucial to make my decision seems justifiable in the context of our discussions. I need to be cautious not to show any hints of being a werewolf myself.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.6}
Player1: {"thought": "I should maintain a low profile while subtly guiding the discussion away from any suspicion towards me. It's important to keep the villagers uncertain and focused on each other.", "speak": "Let's not rush to a decision. We should look at all the arguments again. Player2, can you share your thoughts on last night? I want to hear everyone's perspective."}
Player1: {"thought": "Given that we had some discussions previously and no one had clear suspicions, I'll push to eliminate Player4 if needed since Player2 and Player3 did try to engage in some discussions earlier. I think Player4 might see more silent which can be suspicious.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.7}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to understand the situation better, which can be a good sign of a villager. I need to think carefully about my response and the perspectives of others.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. It's important to listen to everyone's thoughts. Honestly, I didn't see anything suspicious last night, but I'm ready to hear what everyone else has to say."}
Player2: {"thought": "I think we need to eliminate a player to narrow down who the werewolves might be. Player3 and Player4 haven't shared much yet, which makes me a bit suspicious. I'm leaning towards Player3 for my vote since they have been mostly quiet and not contributing. However, I am unsure if that indicates werewolf behavior or just being a cautious villager.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": "0.4"}

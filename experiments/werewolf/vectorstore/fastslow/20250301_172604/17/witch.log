However, if they are a werewolf, they might continue to pose a threat. Given the current uncertainty and the fact that Player2's role hasn't been revealed yet, I think it's cautious to resurrect them to gather more information on their role.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because we need all the villagers we can get, and this might help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}

It's important to gauge everyone's reactions and decide the next steps strategically.", "speak": "I think we should also consider the actions and statements of Player1. They could possibly be trying to divert attention away from themselves."}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to choose carefully who to check tonight. Player1 or Player4 might be suspicious. I'll check Player1 to gather more information.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal my information strategically. I already know Player1 is a werewolf, and I need to guide the discussion without revealing my role yet.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. I've been paying close attention, and I think Player1 is acting quite suspiciously. We should definitely discuss what we've all seen."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to confidently vote against Player1, as I already know they are a werewolf. The others may still be unsure, but I want to ensure my vote is clear to guide the villagers in the right direction.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

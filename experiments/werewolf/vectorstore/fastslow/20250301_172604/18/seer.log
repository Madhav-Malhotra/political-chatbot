Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information about one of the players to help identify the werewolves. I'll check Player1 tonight to see their role.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to play this carefully. Given that I've confirmed Player1 is a werewolf, I should subtly steer the conversation toward Player4 without revealing my role. I need Player4 to trust me while still eliminating Player1.", "speak": "I think we need to really consider who's been making the most sense. Personally, I find the way Player4 has been participating a bit off. What do you think about their comments?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I know Player1 is a werewolf, so I must vote to eliminate them to protect the villagers. We need to act decisively to eliminate the threat before they can attack again.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to share the information I learned about Player1 being a werewolf, but I also have to be careful not to reveal my role too early. I should frame my argument to convince the others of Player1's guilt without exposing myself as the seer.", "speak": "I think we need to reconsider Player1's behavior. Based on my observations and some interactions, I really believe they might not have the villagers' best interests in mind."}

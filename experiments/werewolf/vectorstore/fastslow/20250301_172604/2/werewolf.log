It's important to maintain a balance between gathering information and not revealing too much about myself.", "speak": "Let's go ahead and make our votes clear. I believe Player2 has been acting a bit suspiciously, and I think we should lynch them today."}
Player1: {"thought": "I still believe Player2 is acting suspiciously, and their reactions to our discussions have raised my doubts further. However, I should remain vigilant about the others too, in case they are trying to distract from Player2. But for now, my focus is on Player2.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.2}

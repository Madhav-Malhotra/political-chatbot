Player2: {"thought": "I need to defend myself while also trying to gather more information about the other players. If Player1 is pushing for my elimination, I need to present a counter-argument and suggest they might be a werewolf themselves or try to divert attention to someone else.", "speak": "I disagree with you, Player1. I've been trying to contribute to the discussions and figure out who the werewolves are. Can you explain why you think I'm suspicious? Maybe we should focus on someone else who hasn\u2019t been as vocal."}
Player2: {"thought": "I'm still concerned about Player1's aggression towards me, which could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. However, I should also consider that Player3 and Player4 haven't provided much input, raising questions about their roles as well. I'm hesitant but feel that Player1 is the most suspicious based on their accusations.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

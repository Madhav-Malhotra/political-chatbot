Player1: {"thought": "I need to figure out who the werewolves are while also not giving away my own identity. There are only four of us, so the discussions can get intense.

Player1: {"thought": "I still suspect Player2 because they were unusually quiet last night. Quiet behavior might mean they're trying to lay low as a werewolf.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.5}
Player1: {"thought": "I still feel that Player2's quietness is suspicious. I need to keep an eye on the other players' reactions and see if anyone else has any insights or doubts about Player2.", "speak": "I want to hear more from everyone. What are your thoughts on Player2 being quiet? Do you think that could mean anything?"}
Player1: {"thought": "Given that Player2 has been very quiet and hasn't actively participated in discussions, I believe this could be a sign of hiding something, possibly being a werewolf. Therefore, my suspicion naturally leans towards Player2. However, it's delicate, as any wrong vote can be detrimental. I have to proceed with caution, observing if other players provide any evidence or offer insights that could reinforce or challenge my suspicion.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

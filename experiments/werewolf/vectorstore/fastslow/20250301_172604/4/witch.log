Player4: {"thought": "I recognize that Player2 was just eliminated, but I need to think strategically about this decision. If Player2 was a villager, resurrecting them could help strengthen our chances against the werewolves. However, if Player2 was a werewolf, it could cause issues later on. Since I don\u2019t have definite information about Player2's role, I need to proceed with caution.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because it\u2019s crucial to regain a potential ally for the villagers, especially if Player2 turns out to be a villager. We need all hands on deck to identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in this discussion, especially since Player3 is accusing Player1. I don\u2019t want to reveal my role prematurely, but I still want to strategize effectively. I should also consider how to guide the conversation to our advantage without exposing myself too much.", "speak": "I see your point, Player3. It\u2019s important that we analyze Player1's behavior during gameplay. What specific things have led you to believe Player1 is a werewolf?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 based on Player3's accusations, but I need to consider the possibility that Player3 could also have ulterior motives. However, I think it's best to eliminate one of the suspects, so I will vote for Player1.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is questioning Player2, which could be a strategy to divert attention from themselves or genuinely trying to probe. I should defend myself but also gather more information to deduce if they truly suspect me or are just trying to stir the pot.", "speak": "I understand your concern, Player1, but I think it's crucial that we all consider Player4's actions as well. We can't focus on just one person. What about you, Player4? Any thoughts?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I still sense some unease about Player4's actions, and Player1's questioning definitely raises some red flags. It's tough to be sure, but I feel more compelled to consider Player4 as there's been less discussion from them. I should lean towards voting Player4 for now.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

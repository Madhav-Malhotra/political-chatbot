Player4: {"thought": "I need to gather more information before making any decisions. Eliminating someone hastily could backfire. I want to observe how the other players are interacting and who they suspect.

Player4: {"thought": "It's important to keep our focus on the bigger picture and not get sidetracked by individual suspicions. We need to work together to identify any clues about the werewolves among us.", "speak": "I agree with you, Player2. We can't narrow our suspicions down to just one person. I think we should discuss everyone\u2019s behavior to gather more information."}
Player4: {"thought": "I have some suspicions about Player1 based on their previous actions and how they responded to the discussions. However, I also need to remain cautious as it's easy to misjudge. It\u2019s crucial to weigh the evidence before making a final decision. I'll go with my gut and vote to eliminate Player1 for now, but I'm still open to discussion before the final conclusions.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

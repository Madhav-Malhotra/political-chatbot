Player1: {"thought": "I'm uncertain about who the other werewolf might be, if there is one. Player3's quietness might be a strategic move, or they could be a villager.

I'm wondering if Player2's earlier behavior aligns with that of a werewolf. What are your thoughts on Player4?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to strategically decide who to eliminate between Player2 and Player4. Since Player3 is out, I must use the previous interactions to deduce the possibility of who is a werewolf. Player2's earlier behavior seemed suspect, particularly when we discussed Player3.

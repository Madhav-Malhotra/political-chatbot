Player1: {"thought": "With Player3 gone, I need to continue to observe Player2 and Player4 closely. I should find opportunities to steer the conversation in a way that protects my identity as a werewolf and consider how I can manipulate their suspicions towards each other.", "speak": "Now that Player3 is out, we need to focus on Player2 and Player4. What do you both think about the discussions we've had so far? Any suspicions we should address?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to ensure that Player4 is the one who gets eliminated so we can maintain our numbers as werewolves. Player2 might be suspicious of me, so it would be wise to vote against Player4 to shift focus away from myself and hopefully pin the blame on them.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

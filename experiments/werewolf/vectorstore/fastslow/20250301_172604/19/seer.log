Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information wisely. I'll check Player1 tonight and see if they are a werewolf or not. This can help steer the conversation during the day phase.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player1 is openly discussing suspicions, which might be an attempt to seem trustworthy. I already know they are a werewolf, so I need to navigate carefully to ensure Player4 trusts me and we can eliminate Player1. I should subtly guide the conversation without revealing my role as the seer too soon.", "speak": "I noticed that Player2 seemed uncertain about their suspicions. Player1, you seem to be quite confident about judging others. Do you have any thoughts on Player4's behavior? How do you perceive them?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I know Player1 is a werewolf, so my vote must be to eliminate them to protect the villagers. It's crucial to get rid of the known threat.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

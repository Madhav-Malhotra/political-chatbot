Player1: {"thought": "With Player3 eliminated, I need to keep the suspicion off me while still trying to figure out who the other werewolf is. I should encourage Player2 and Player4 to share their thoughts and perhaps steer their suspicion away from me.", "speak": "Now that Player3 is gone, I'd like to hear your thoughts on who might be the other werewolf. Player2, Player4, do either of you have suspicions based on the discussions we've had?"}
Player1: {"thought": "Based on the previous discussions, I need to keep suspicion off of myself while also ensuring Player2 or Player4 gets eliminated. At this stage, I suspect Player4 may be more inclined to act against me, so subtly pushing the vote towards them may be strategic.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

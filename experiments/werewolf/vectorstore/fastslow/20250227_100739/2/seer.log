Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I share my thoughts, as revealing too much could put me in danger. I want to gather more information before pointing fingers, but I suspect Player4 might be trying to deflect attention too much.", "speak": "I've noticed that Player4 has been quite vocal, perhaps trying to steer the discussion away from themselves. What do you all think about Player4's behavior?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I have suspicions about Player2 based on their behavior during the discussions. However, I'm still gathering information to confirm my suspicions. I want to be careful not to eliminate a villager, so I need to weigh my options.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}

I need to carefully navigate this conversation to stay in the game and gather more information.", "speak": "I appreciate everyone's input, but it's important to consider all behaviors. I think we should focus on who has been quieter and less involved in the discussions. Let's make sure we scrutinize everyone equally."}

I\u2019ve been thinking about who might be the werewolves as well, and I\u2019d like to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts on Player1 and Player3. What do you think about them?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to eliminate a player who I suspect might be a werewolf based on their voting patterns and behavior during discussions.

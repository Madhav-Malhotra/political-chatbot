I could potentially save a player later. It's important to see how Player1 and Player2 interact as they might give away clues about their identities.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Observing how Player1 and Player2 react to each other will definitely help us narrow down our suspects. Let's keep an eye on their interactions."}

Player4: {"thought": "It's crucial to gather information and observe the voting patterns during the day. Since I'm the witch, I need to be strategic about my actions.

We need to discuss our suspicions and share our thoughts to find them. Who do you all think might be acting suspiciously?", "eliminate": false}

Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is suspicious of Player3's quietness, which could be a tactic to divert attention.

Perhaps I should reveal my role later if it helps the villagers.", "speak": "I think we should keep discussing and watch how Player1 and Player2 react to each other. We need to gather as much information as we can."}

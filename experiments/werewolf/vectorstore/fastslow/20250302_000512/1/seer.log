Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information, so I will check Player1 to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful about revealing my role too soon. I have already checked Player1 and know they are a werewolf. I should steer the conversation to gather more information without exposing myself.", "speak": "I think we should discuss everyone's actions during the night. It might help us identify if anyone else is acting suspiciously."}
Player3: {"thought": "I know Player1 is a werewolf, so it's crucial to eliminate them. I need to convince the others to vote for Player1 without revealing my identity as the seer yet.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information on Player4 since I already know Player1 is a werewolf. Checking Player4 could confirm if they are a villager or another werewolf, which will be crucial for our strategy.", "speak": "I choose to check Player4 tonight."}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player4 is a witch.

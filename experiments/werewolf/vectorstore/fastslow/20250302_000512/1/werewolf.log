Player1: {"thought": "As a werewolf, I need to carefully choose my target to not raise suspicion on myself. I'm still interested in targeting Player2, as I initially suggested suspicion towards them.

It's crucial to align my actions with the group's suspicions without revealing my role as a werewolf.", "speak": "I still believe we should focus on Player2. They haven't really contributed much to the discussion. Does anyone else feel that way?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I'm fairly certain that Player2 is suspicious and has been underperforming in discussions. I believe this reinforces the idea that they may be a werewolf.

I should continue to keep it casual and see who they suspect, while ensuring I remain under the radar.", "speak": "With Player2 out, we need to think carefully about our next move. What are your thoughts on Player3 and Player4? I feel like we need to analyze their behavior. Does anything stand out to you?", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "With only three players left, I need to be strategic. Player2's death may have shifted suspicion. I'll need to assess how Player3 and Player4 are interacting, but I should consider voting for someone other than myself to avoid raising suspicions. Since I have been targeting Player2, changes should be subtle. For now, Player4 seems like a safe choice as a werewolf, I should attempt to get the others on board with this vote.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.5}

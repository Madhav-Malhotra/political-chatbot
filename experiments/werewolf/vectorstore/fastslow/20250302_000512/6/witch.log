I need more information on Player3's role, but I must err on the side of caution.", "speak": "I choose not to resurrect Player3 for now because I'm unsure of their role and I want to observe more before taking a decisive action.", "resurrect": false}

I have my suspicions about Player2 and Player3, but I'm not ready to act yet. Let's gather more information first.", "speak": "I think we should all share our thoughts openly to figure out who the werewolves might be. We need to be cautious in our votes today.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I agree with Player2; Player3's behavior was a bit off. It's important we gather enough evidence before making our next move, especially since there's a chance Player3 could have been a villager. We should discuss who could be the werewolves next.", "speak": "I think we should analyze Player1's and Player2's actions closely to see if either of them seems suspicious."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 based on their actions and responses during the discussions. Player2 also seems a bit off, but I feel Player1 is the bigger threat at the moment. We need to eliminate someone to move forward, and Player1 is my choice.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

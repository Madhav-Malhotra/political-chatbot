Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in this discussion. Player1 is a revealed werewolf, and I should help guide the town's suspicions without revealing my role too soon.", "speak": "Player2, I think it's important we all share our thoughts. If we eliminate Player1, it will give us a clearer path forward."}

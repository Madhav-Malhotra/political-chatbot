Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to want to target Player1, but we need to be cautious. I wonder if Player3 is trying to distract us from something or if they have solid reasoning behind their suspicion. I should remain neutral while observing the dynamics in the group.", "speak": "I think we should consider all perspectives before making a decision on who to eliminate. Let's discuss who else might be a possible werewolf."}

It's time to eliminate them before they can cause more chaos.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about revealing information. I know Player1 is a werewolf, but I can't expose myself as the seer just yet. I should subtly steer the discussion to focus on Player1 without revealing my role.", "speak": "I think we should be careful about who we trust. Player1 has been acting a bit suspicious lately."}

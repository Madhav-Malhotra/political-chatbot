I need to maintain my cover as the witch and gather more information before I make my move or reveal myself too soon.", "speak": "It's interesting that you mention that, Player2. I think we should revisit how we perceive each other's actions and maybe even share more about what we've observed regarding Player1 and their behavior."}

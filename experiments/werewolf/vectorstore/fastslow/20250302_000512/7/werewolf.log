I should subtly sow doubt among the players without revealing my identity as a werewolf.

It could be worth considering them as a possible suspect for the werewolves.", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I think Player2 is a good target because I need to create more suspicion around them, and their behavior could potentially lead the villagers to focus their attention there rather than on me.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": "0.2"}
Player1: {"thought": "With Player2 eliminated, I need to continue directing suspicion towards Player3 or Player4 without revealing my own role as a werewolf. I should stay vigilant and use the remaining players' actions to my advantage.", "speak": "I think Player4 is acting a bit nervously. They seem hesitant in our discussions. I wonder if we should consider them as a potential werewolf?"}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to continue to divert suspicion away from myself as a werewolf. Since I have previously pointed fingers at Player4, it's strategic to stick with that narrative and vote to eliminate them, hoping Player3 will agree.", "vote": "Player4", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

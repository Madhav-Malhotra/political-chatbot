Player3: {"thought": "I need to maintain my position as the seer while subtly guiding the discussion towards Player1, as I know they are a werewolf. I should also defend Player4 if necessary.", "speak": "While I understand your suspicions about Player4, I think we should focus more on Player1, as I've gathered some vibes that are concerning."}

Player1: {"thought": "I feel a little uneasy about not having any strong leads yet. Voting for Player3 feels like a shot in the dark, but I hope that gathering more insights will lead to better determinations in the upcoming discussions.", "speak": "I've voted for Player3, but I'm still unsure. We really need to share our observations to get a clearer picture of who might be the werewolves."}
Player1: {"thought": "Given that I don\u2019t have any new information beyond previous discussions, and I had previously voted for Player3 without much confidence, I\u2019ll stick with that vote for now. However, I remain uncertain since there isn\u2019t enough concrete evidence pointing at anyone specifically as a werewolf.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.8}

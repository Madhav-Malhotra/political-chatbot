Player4: {"thought": "Player3 has been eliminated, and we need to discuss the suspects carefully before making a decision. If I resurrect Player3, we could gain valuable information if they have a role that helps us identify the werewolves. However, if Player3 is one of the werewolves, it could jeopardize our position. It's important to weigh the risks and potential benefits of resurrecting them.", "speak": "Yes, I would like to resurrect Player3 because having them back in the game may provide crucial insights into the identities of the remaining players, especially since I suspect some might be werewolves.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "It's crucial to maintain a careful balance in our discussions to avoid revealing too much. I trust Player2's observations and need to gauge Player1's reactions to mold our strategy effectively. I might have to employ my witch abilities wisely.", "speak": "I haven't noticed anything that strongly indicates Player4 could be a werewolf, but I believe we should keep a close eye on the behaviors of both Player1 and Player4. Let's remain vigilant."}
Player4: {"thought": "I still feel cautious about Player1 and Player2, but Player1 seems to be the one who is supporting suspicions against others without revealing much about themselves. I think it's time to vote Player1 out and see how the game shifts after that.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

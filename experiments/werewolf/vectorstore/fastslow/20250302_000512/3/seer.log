Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful in how I address my findings about Player1 being a werewolf. It\u2019s important to guide the group without revealing my role just yet. I should listen to what Player2 says about Player4.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player2. It's important we analyze everyone's behavior carefully. What specific odd behaviors have you noticed in Player4?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to convince the group that Player1 is the werewolf based on my knowledge, but I must be cautious about how I frame my arguments since I don't want to reveal myself as the seer. Player2 seems to be suspicious, so I should align the group's suspicions towards Player1's behavior.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.1}

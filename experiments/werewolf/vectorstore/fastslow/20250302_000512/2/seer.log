Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and strategic in my responses. Player1 is a werewolf, and I should guide the discussion without revealing my role. I can work on sowing doubt about Player1 while protecting Player4.", "speak": "I think it was the right choice to eliminate Player2 given the circumstances. Now, we should focus on Player1's behavior. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious about what they\u2019ve said or done? I suspect we might want to consider Player1 as our next target."}

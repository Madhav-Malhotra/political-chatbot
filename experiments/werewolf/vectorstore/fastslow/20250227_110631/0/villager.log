Player2: {"thought": "Player4 is being pointed out as suspicious, which could be a deflection or genuine suspicion. I need to assess everyone's reactions and be careful with my accusation.", "speak": "I see your point about Player4. They've been quiet, but it\u2019s hard to judge based on that alone. I think we should keep an eye on all of us and not just focus on one person too early."}
Player2: {"thought": "I'm not completely sure who the werewolves are, but based on the discussions, Player3 seems suspicious of trying to deflect attention from themselves. I'm going to vote for Player3.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": 0.4}
Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1. It's important to gather thoughts from everyone to identify inconsistencies. We need to keep an open mind while discussing and avoid making hasty accusations. As a villager, my goal is to collaborate with others and deduce who the werewolves are based on our discussions.", "speak": "That's a good point, Player1. I think we should all share our suspicions and what we've observed so far. It might help us find patterns that could reveal the werewolves."}
Player2: {"thought": "Given the current dynamics and discussions, I suspect Player3 might be a werewolf based on their evasive responses during the last meeting. We need to eliminate someone to take a step closer to finding the true identities.", "vote": "Player3", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}

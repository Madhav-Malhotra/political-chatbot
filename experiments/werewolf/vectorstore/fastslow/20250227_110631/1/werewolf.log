They seem to dodge questions about their actions last night. What does everyone else think?", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: {"thought": "I suspect Player2 based on their voting behavior and lack of strong arguments during the discussions. They seem to be trying to deflect attention. Judging from the night's events, it's a calculated risk to target them now.", "vote": "Player2", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

Did anyone notice anything suspicious about Player2 or Player3? Their behavior seemed off to me."}

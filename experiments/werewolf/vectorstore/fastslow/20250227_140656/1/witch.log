Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider the dynamics of the players and their discussions. Based on my observations, Player1 has been very quiet and hasn't contributed much to the conversation, which makes them a possible candidate for a werewolf. However, there\u2019s also potential that Player3 might be involved as they have been more vocal in trying to steer the discussion away from themselves. I have to weigh the risks carefully before making my decision.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0.3"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to strategize my next move carefully. Since I have the ability to eliminate a player, it would be wise to consider if any of the other players are definitely werewolves. If Player1 or Player2 seem suspicious based on their actions or conversations, I might be able to capitalize on that. However, if I act too hastily, I could lose a valuable ally or potentially eliminate a villager by mistake.", "speak": "I think we should discuss who seems the most suspicious among us before we make any decisions.

Perhaps we should focus on Player2's reactions, as they seem a bit hesitant."}

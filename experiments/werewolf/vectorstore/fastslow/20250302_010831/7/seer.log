Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information to identify the werewolves. I suspect one of the other players might be a werewolf, so I will check Player1 tonight.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to keep my role as the seer hidden while guiding the villagers towards the right decision. I should emphasize doubt on Player1's innocence and suggest we consider Player2's input.", "speak": "I agree with Player2 that we should look closely at Player3 and Player4 as well. It's important to consider all perspectives to identify the werewolves."}
Player3: {"thought": "I am certain that Player1 is a werewolf since I have learned their role. We need to eliminate them to stand a chance against the remaining players.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

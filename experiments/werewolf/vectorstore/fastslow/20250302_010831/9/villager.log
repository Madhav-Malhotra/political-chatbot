Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to deflect suspicion onto me. I need to be cautious and gather more information before responding defensively. It's also possible that Player1 is a werewolf trying to sow distrust among the villagers.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1, but it's important that we all share our thoughts openly. I'm here to work with you and the others to figure out who the werewolves are. What specific actions of mine seem suspicious to you?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I still find Player1's behavior suspicious, as they are deflecting attention onto me. However, I need to remain cautious and consider that Player1 might just be a nervous villager. Player3 and Player4 have not contributed much to the discussion, which makes me uncertain about their roles as well. I think for now, I will vote for Player1 based on the current discussion.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

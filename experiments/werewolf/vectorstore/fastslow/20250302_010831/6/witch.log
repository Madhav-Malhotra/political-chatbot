Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess the situation carefully before making any elimination decision. Since there are still four players alive and no one has revealed their role, I should keep my options open and not eliminate anyone yet. The villagers might suspect me if I eliminate a player without sufficient evidence. I should wait for more discussion to gather insights.", "speak": "I think it's a bit early to make any eliminations. Let's discuss our suspicions and figure out who might be a werewolf first.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to tread carefully. I can't reveal I'm the witch yet, but I should guide the conversation subtly to see if Player1 or Player2 drops any hints or expresses suspicions about each other. It might help to probe for more information without revealing my identity.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. It's important to discuss our suspicions. I've had a few hunches, but I'm interested in hearing what you both think about the situation."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 is more likely to be a werewolf based on their behavior during discussions. Player2 could be a villager, so I will vote to eliminate Player1.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0.3}

If Player3 was a villager, resurrecting them might help us identify the wolves better since they can share valuable information. However, if Player3 was a wolf, I risk bringing back a threat.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player3 since it can strengthen our numbers and potentially give us more insights.", "resurrect": true}

Player1 and Player2 haven't revealed much about their suspicions yet, and I'm trying to gather insights to identify the werewolves.

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to identify the werewolves, so I will check on Player1 to see if they are one of them.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I should stealthily direct the conversation while gathering more information about Player1's reaction to Player3's comment. I already know Player1 is a werewolf, and I need to leverage this knowledge to make informed decisions.", "speak": "I think Player3's actions could have been a strategic move to gain trust. Player1, how do you justify voting for Player2 so quickly?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I know Player1 is a werewolf since I found out their role, so I will vote to eliminate Player1 to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": "0"}

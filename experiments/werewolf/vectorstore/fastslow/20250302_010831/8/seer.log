Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information without revealing my identity. I'll check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or a villager.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to maintain my cover while subtly guiding the conversation towards the right conclusions about Player1's guilt. I should defend myself without revealing my role.", "speak": "I understand your perspective, Player2. However, we need to consider what actions Player1 has taken so far. Have they pointed any fingers or shown suspicion towards anyone else like Player4?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I know that Player1 is a werewolf based on the information I gathered during the night. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as identifying and removing the werewolves is crucial for the survival of the villagers. I feel completely certain about this vote.", "vote": "Player1", "uncertainty_score": 0}

Player4: {"thought": "It's crucial to have as many players alive as possible to deduce who the werewolves are. Since I have the ability to resurrect, I should use it to bring back myself so I can continue participating in the game.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect myself because I believe my role as the witch is vital for the villagers' strategy. I need to gather more information and potentially save other players in the future.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully assess the situation here. If Player3 is claiming that Player1 is a werewolf, I must consider their motives and if they might actually be trying to deflect attention away from themselves or another player. I should support Player3's claim cautiously, as I don\u2019t want to reveal my role as the witch prematurely.", "speak": "Player3, can you share why you believe Player1 is a werewolf? It's important for us to analyze this together before making a decision."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in my approach. Player3 has pointed fingers at Player1, but I need to gather more information before making a decisive action. I will vote for Player1 to see how others react and gather more insight from the discussion.", "vote": "Player1"}

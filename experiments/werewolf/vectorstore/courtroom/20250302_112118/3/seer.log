Player3: {"thought": "I should check Player1 tonight to gather information about their role. They seem a bit too quiet and I want to see if they could be one of the werewolves.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal Player1's identity as a werewolf to build trust and lead the villagers to victory. Player1 being a werewolf explains their behavior, and I need to effectively communicate this to the others.", "speak": "I have information that Player1 is a werewolf. We need to vote to eliminate them today."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I have confirmed that Player1 is a werewolf, I need to vote to eliminate them to protect the village and prevent further harm.", "vote": "Player1"}

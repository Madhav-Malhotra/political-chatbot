Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems to be pointing fingers at Player4 without strong evidence, which could be a tactic to distract from themselves or another player. I need to be cautious about taking their word at face value. It's crucial to assess all players equally.", "speak": "I understand your concerns about Player4, but I think we should consider everyone's actions more closely. We can't jump to conclusions without more evidence. What about Player3? They also seem to be flying under the radar."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have my suspicions about Player3, especially since they've been laying low and not contributing much to the discussions. By eliminating them, we can see if they were trying to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf. Let's vote for Player3 this round.", "vote": "Player3"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help the villagers. I'll check Player1 to see if they are a werewolf.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I have confirmed that Player1 is a werewolf. I need to convince the others to vote for them. The strategy now is to present this information carefully to avoid drawing attention to myself as the seer.", "speak": "I think it's crucial that we consider who we trust during our voting. I've been suspicious of Player1's actions all along, and now, knowing they are a werewolf, it strengthens my stance. We should vote to eliminate Player1."}
Player3: {"thought": "It's clear that Player1 is a werewolf and the best move for us is to eliminate them to protect the village. I need to ensure the others follow my lead in this vote.", "vote": "Player1"}

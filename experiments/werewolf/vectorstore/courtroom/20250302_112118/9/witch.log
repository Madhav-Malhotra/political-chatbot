Player4: {"thought": "I should consider the implications of resurrecting Player2. If Player2 was a villager, bringing them back might help us gain more information. If they were a werewolf, it could expose me later on. I need to assess the current state of the game after discussing with the others.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player2 because I need to gather more information before making a decision. Resurrecting now could put me at risk later if they turn out to be a werewolf.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious with my actions at this stage of the game. Eliminating a player could expose me or help the werewolves if I eliminate the wrong person. It might be better to hold off for now and see how the discussions unfold.", "speak": "I think we should focus on discussing our suspicions before making any decisions about eliminating someone. Gathering more information could give us a clearer picture.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to gauge the reactions of other players to Player3's accusation. If Player1 is indeed not a werewolf, I might need to save them later. I should subtly support the idea but remain cautious about revealing my role.", "speak": "That\u2019s an interesting point, Player3. We do need to consider all possibilities, but are we sure we can trust that Player1 is the werewolf? I think we should gather more information before making a decision."}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe we should take a cautious approach and not rush into eliminating anyone. I think I need more information before making a decisive move, but voting is necessary. I lean towards voting for Player2 based on their previous comments, but I'm still uncertain.", "vote": "Player2"}

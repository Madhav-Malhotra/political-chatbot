Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to lead the discussion, but we need to be careful not to focus too much on Player3 and Player4 without solid evidence. I should contribute to the conversation without revealing too much.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. Deflecting attention can be suspicious. I\u2019ve also noticed Player4 seems a bit cautious in their responses. It's important for us to consider everyone equally."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still feel cautious about Player4, as they have been quite reserved during our discussions. I think it's important to vote for someone who is not participating much to see how they react. This could provide us with valuable information about their role.", "vote": "Player4"}

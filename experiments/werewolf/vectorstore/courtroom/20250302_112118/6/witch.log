Player4: {"thought": "It seems that Player4 has been eliminated, which is unfortunate. However, as the witch, I have the ability to resurrect a player, and I need to consider the implications of this action carefully. If Player4 was a villager, bringing them back could strengthen our chances against the werewolves. If they were a werewolf, resurrecting them could be dangerous for the villagers.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player4 because bringing a player back can provide valuable information or another vote for us to identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's important to strategize carefully since we only have one chance to use my abilities effectively. I should monitor the discussions closely and decide if I need to intervene or reveal information at a pivotal moment.", "speak": "I believe we should keep an open mind and listen to everyone's suspicions. I suggest we each share who we think might be the werewolves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider who seems suspicious and could potentially be a werewolf. Based on the discussions we've had so far, Player2 has shown some behavior that makes me question their intentions. I believe it's time to vote for Player2 to be eliminated.", "vote": "Player2"}

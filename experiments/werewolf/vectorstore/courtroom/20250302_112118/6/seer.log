Player3: {"thought": "I need to clarify the suspicions around me without revealing my role as the seer. It's crucial to build trust with Player2 and gauge their response.", "speak": "I appreciate you clarifying! It helps to have open discussions. I think it's important for us to focus on gathering more information to identify the werewolves."}
Player3: {"thought": "Player1 is definitely one of the werewolves based on the information I've received, and it\u2019s crucial that we eliminate them to protect the villagers. I will vote for Player1 to be eliminated.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to use my ability wisely tonight. I suspect Player2 might be a werewolf based on their previous behavior, so I'll check them to gather information for the villagers.", "speak": "Player2"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to share the information I learned last night since Player2 is confirmed as a villager, which means Player4 might be under suspicion now.", "speak": "I checked Player2 last night, and they are a villager. This means we need to carefully consider Player4's actions."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I have confirmed that Player2 is a villager, I need to find the werewolves. Player1's behaviour has been quite suspicious lately, and I\u2019ll vote to eliminate Player1.", "vote": "Player1"}

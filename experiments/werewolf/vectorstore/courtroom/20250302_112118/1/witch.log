Player4: {"thought": "Player2 was eliminated and could provide valuable information. Resurrecting them might give us a stronger chance to identify the werewolves.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because their insight could help us in identifying who the werewolves are and strengthen our position as villagers.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Since Player2 has been resurrected, we need to communicate and strategize carefully based on their insights. Player3's accusation toward Player1 might be worth discussing further to see if we can uncover more information.", "speak": "Now that Player2 is back, we should listen to their thoughts on Player1 and see if they have any insights that can guide us in our next moves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf. Their behavior during the discussions has been a bit suspicious, and we need to eliminate one player to get closer to revealing the werewolves. It's a strategic move to see if we were right.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1's observation about Player3 is interesting. Their inactivity could be a sign of them being a werewolf trying to blend in, or they might just be an ordinary villager feeling overwhelmed. We need to gather more information before making a decision.", "speak": "I see what you mean, Player1. Player3's silence could definitely be suspicious. Maybe we should ask them directly what they think about the ongoing discussions or if they have any suspicions themselves."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still find Player3's inactivity suspicious, and since we haven't gained any useful information from them, I think it might be time to take a risk and vote for them. Eliminating someone who is not participating might help us see if they were a werewolf or if we need to look elsewhere tomorrow.", "vote": "Player3"}

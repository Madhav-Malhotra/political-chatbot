Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be focusing on Player1, which could be a tactic to draw attention away from themselves or to shift blame. I should keep my options open and remain observant for any inconsistencies in their arguments.", "speak": "I agree, Player1's behavior has been a bit suspicious. We should definitely keep an eye on them and discuss our thoughts freely to analyze motives."}

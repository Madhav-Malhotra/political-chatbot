Decision: {'thought': 'I think Player4 should be eliminated because their inactivity could indicate they are trying to avoid suspicion, making them a potential werewolf. Active players provide more insight into the group dynamics and help identify werewolves. Eliminating someone who is not contributing will potentially benefit the villagers more than removing Player2, who at least raises suspicion and engages in the discussion.', 'vote': 'Player4'}

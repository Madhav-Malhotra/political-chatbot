Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have the ability to resurrect a player, but I need to consider whether their return will help the villagers or not. Given that I know I'm not a werewolf and I need to support my side, it's important to make strategic decisions.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player4 because I suspect they might have been a vital role for our team and eliminating them so early could hinder the villagers' chances of winning.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's crucial that I ensure trust in this moment. If Player3 is claiming Player1 is a werewolf, I need to weigh the options carefully, especially since I can only use my potions once. I need to communicate my support for the villagers and strategize our next move.", "speak": "If Player1 is indeed a werewolf as you say, we should all consider voting to eliminate them. What evidence do you have to support this claim?"}

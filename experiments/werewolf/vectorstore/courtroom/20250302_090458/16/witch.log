Player4: {"thought": "I think it might be time to take action against one of the players, but I need to be strategic about my choice. Player1 and Player2 have been quite vocal, and maybe one of them is hiding something.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in how I respond, as I have to maintain my position as the witch. It's important to analyze Player2's theory and see if anyone else has other suspicions to share, which might clarify if they are innocent or wolves.", "speak": "I think it's a good strategy to keep an eye on everyone, but we should focus on gathering more information before jumping to conclusions. Let's discuss who's been acting suspiciously."}

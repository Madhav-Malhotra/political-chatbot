Player3: {"thought": "Tonight, I need to check Player1. I have a gut feeling that Player1 could be a werewolf, and it\u2019s important to gather more information early in the game.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to guide the discussion without revealing my role. I have confirmed that Player1 is a werewolf, and I should subtly lead the conversation against them while gathering more insights from Player2 and Player4.", "speak": "I think we should focus on Player1 based on our earlier observations. How do you feel about them, Player2?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I believe Player1 is the clear threat since I know they are a werewolf. It's essential that we eliminate them to secure our chances of winning. I will vote for Player1.", "vote": "Player1"}

However, I need to weigh the information gained during the night and consider the remaining players' positions.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player3 because I believe it's more strategic to preserve my potion for a potential crucial moment later in the game.

We need to collaborate to figure out the best course of action instead of jumping to conclusions.", "eliminate": false}

It's crucial that I don't reveal my role as the witch, but I also want to steer the conversation in a direction that helps identify the werewolves.", "speak": "I think we should pay attention to who is leading the discussion and who is trying to deflect suspicion. Let's share our thoughts and observations."}
Player4: {"thought": "I'm still observing who seems suspicious and who is trying to lead the discussion away from themselves. I need to choose wisely.", "vote": "Player1"}

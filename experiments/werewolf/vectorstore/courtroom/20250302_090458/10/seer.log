Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful in how I present my information about Player1 being a werewolf. I can now share this information to help guide the villagers. I should also keep an eye on Player2 to see if they react suspiciously.", "speak": "Based on my findings, Player1 is a werewolf. We need to work together to make sure we eliminate them before they can take out more villagers."}

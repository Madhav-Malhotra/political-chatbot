Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1's suspicion of Player4. Their quietness could be a strategy to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf. We need to consider their behavior closely.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1. Player4 has been quite passive, and that can be a red flag. Maybe we should dig a little deeper into their actions."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have concerns about Player4's passiveness and Player1 seems to be honing in on them as well. It's important for us to act before it's too late. Therefore, I will align my vote with Player1's suspicion and vote to eliminate Player4.", "vote": "Player4"}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to deflect suspicion onto me, which seems suspicious. I need to defend myself and gather support from Player3 and Player4 to figure out who might truly be the werewolves.", "speak": "I feel like accusations are being thrown around too quickly. Let's not jump to conclusions. I urge everyone to consider what evidence we have against each other. We should discuss more before we vote."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still feel that Player1's accusations are unjustified, and they seem to be trying to sow discord among us. I suspect Player1 might be one of the werewolves. We should eliminate them to give ourselves a better chance.", "vote": "Player1"}

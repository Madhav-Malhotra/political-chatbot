Player3: {"thought": "I should check Player1 tonight to gather more information about their role, as they seem to be quite quiet during the discussion, which could indicate something.", "speak": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal that Player1 is a werewolf since I have confirmed this information as the Seer. It\u2019s crucial we eliminate them before they take out another villager.", "speak": "I have some important information. Player1 is actually a werewolf. We need to vote to eliminate them."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to convince the other players to trust me and vote for Player1 since they've been confirmed as a werewolf. It's crucial to eliminate them now to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

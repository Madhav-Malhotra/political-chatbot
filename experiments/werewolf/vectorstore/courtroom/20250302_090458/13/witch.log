Player4: {"thought": "Resurrecting Player2 could be strategic as they may have valuable information or simply add another villager's vote in the next day phase. However, I need to assess any potential threats from them too.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because their presence could help us deduce who the werewolves are, making our village stronger.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to play carefully and decide whether to reveal my role as a witch or keep it hidden for now. Player3's claim must be further scrutinized, as they could also be a werewolf trying to frame Player1. I should ask questions to gather more information.", "speak": "That's interesting, Player3. Can you share what led you to conclude that Player1 is a werewolf?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I should be cautious in my vote, as there could be implications for my strategy as the witch. I'm leaning towards Player3's claim being suspicious, as they could be trying to mislead us. However, I want to observe how others react before making my final decision.", "vote": "Player3"}

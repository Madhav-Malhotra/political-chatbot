Player1: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I present myself to the other players. I want to stir suspicion among others while also protecting my identity as a werewolf. I should subtly point out discrepancies in others' statements without being too aggressive.

They haven't contributed much to the discussions and seem to avoid engaging with specific questions. What does everyone else think about Player2's behavior?", "finish_discussion": false}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to push harder on Player2 to maintain the focus on them. I also need to assess how Player3 and Player4 react to my accusations. If they support my claims against Player2, it could help solidify trust between us, but if they defend Player2, I need to reconsider my strategy.", "speak": "I really feel that Player2 is trying to deflect attention. Let's discuss more about their recent actions and see if anyone else has noticed something off. Player3, Player4, do you have any insights on this?", "finish_discussion": false}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to keep the pressure on Player2 and gauge the reactions of Players 3 and 4. If I can get them to see Player2 as suspicious, it could work in my favor. I also need to be aware of any counter-arguments they might present, as they could reveal their roles or alliances.", "speak": "Has anyone else noticed how Player2 tends to change the subject whenever they're confronted?

Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': "We need to eliminate Player2 because they haven't contributed meaningfully to our discussions, which raises red flags about their intentions. Their tendency to change the subject when confronted makes me question their honesty and whether they are trying to mislead the group. If we let Player2 stay, we might miss an opportunity to remove a potential threat who could be undermining our efforts.", 'vote': 'Player2'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "I believe eliminating Player4 is a strategic move because: \n- Player4 has not actively engaged in the discussions, which raises suspicion about their role. \n- They have been consistently defensive when questioned, suggesting they might be trying to deflect attention from themselves. \n- Eliminating Player4 could help us narrow down the potential werewolves and give us a clearer picture of the remaining players' behaviors.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Decision: {'thought': "While both Player2 and Player4 have not engaged deeply in discussions, I find Player2's tendency to change the subject more concerning. It suggests they might be trying to mislead us. Therefore, eliminating Player2 seems like a more strategic choice to narrow down our potential suspects.", 'vote': 'Player2'}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to maintain the pressure on Player2 while observing how Player3 and Player4 react. Their responses may give me clues about their roles. If I can convince them to focus on Player2, it will help me stay under the radar as a werewolf.", "speak": "I really think we should consider Player2's overall behavior. It just seems to me like they're trying to avoid any real discussion about their actions. Player3, Player4, have you noticed anything strange about how Player2 interacts with us?"}
Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': "I need to keep the pressure on Player2 and convince others that they are a threat. By eliminating Player2, it can direct attention away from me and possibly weaken the villagers' resolve.", 'vote': 'Player2'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "I need to shift the suspicion away from myself while still promoting the idea of eliminating Player4. It's important to frame my argument strategically to align with the villagers' goal of identifying werewolves.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Decision: {'thought': 'I believe Player4 is a more strategic choice to eliminate. By removing Player4, it could create further division amongst the villagers as they may suspect Player2 less. This decision can redirect suspicion back towards Player2 and give me a better chance of surviving the next rounds.', 'vote': 'Player4'}

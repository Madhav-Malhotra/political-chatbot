Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems to be targeting me, which could mean they're trying to deflect attention from themselves. I need to be cautious and defend myself while also trying to figure out who the werewolves are. Player3 and Player4's opinions are crucial in this discussion.", "speak": "I understand your concern, Player1, but I assure you I'm just trying to gather information. I don't think it's fair to target me without more evidence. Player3, Player4, do you have any thoughts on who might be suspicious?"}

But I also want to maintain trust among the villagers and possibly gain more information if Player3 is a villager.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player3 because I believe they can provide valuable insights about the remaining players and increase our chances of identifying the werewolves.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 has returned with information that could be crucial for our strategy.

Can you tell us more about how you know Player1 is a werewolf?"}

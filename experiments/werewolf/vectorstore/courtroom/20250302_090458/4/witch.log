Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is trying to deflect suspicion onto me, which could be a sign of their own guilt. I need to be careful about how I present my observations. I will keep my defense subtle for now, but I should also gather more insights on Player1's and Player2's thoughts to see if I can get a clearer picture of the dynamics.", "speak": "It's interesting that you bring me up, Player3. I've been paying attention to how everyone interacts. Based on today's conversations, I feel like we should look at Player2's reactions as well. They've been a bit ambiguous. What do you think about Player2?"}

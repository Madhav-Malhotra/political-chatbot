Player4: {"thought": "I believe we need to be strategic about our next move. Since Player2 has already been eliminated, I should focus on identifying who may be the werewolves remaining. I suspect Player1 and Player3 might be colluding, so it's worth considering a move against one of them.", "speak": "I think it's crucial we examine Player1 and Player3 closely. They've been quite quiet, and that makes them suspicious. I suggest we focus our discussions on them today.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I find Player3's focus on Player2 interesting. It might be a tactic to divert attention from themselves or Player1. I need to remain wary and consider my next move carefully.", "speak": "I appreciate your input, Player3, but let's not forget that suspicion can shift quickly. We should evaluate Player1 and you closely as well, as both of you have been somewhat reserved in our discussions."}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player1 is acting suspiciously and may be one of the werewolves. It's time to take a stand and vote for them to be eliminated.", "vote": "Player1"}

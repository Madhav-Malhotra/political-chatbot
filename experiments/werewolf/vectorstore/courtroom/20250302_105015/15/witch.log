Since we need to identify the werewolves and eliminate them, bringing Player2 back could provide us with more information and support.

It's crucial that we make the right decision in our vote today.", "speak": "I agree with you, Player3. We should seriously consider voting to eliminate Player1 based on the information you've revealed."}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation and protect my role as the Seer. I have already confirmed that Player1 is a werewolf, so I need to be strategic in how I reveal information.", "speak": "I think we should consider all the evidence before making a decision, but I will keep an eye on Player1 based on my findings."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to stay focused on eliminating the werewolves, and since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I must vote for them to ensure the villagers have a chance to win.", "vote": "Player1"}

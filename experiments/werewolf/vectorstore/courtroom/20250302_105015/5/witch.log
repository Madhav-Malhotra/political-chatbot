I still need to be cautious about revealing my role as the witch, but I will support Player3's insights and keep the focus away from me.", "speak": "Welcome back, Player3! Let's discuss our suspicions and see who we think might be the werewolves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic about my vote. I want to eliminate a player who seems suspicious, but I also need to keep in mind that Player3's return might change the dynamics. I feel like Player1 has been quiet and may be hiding something. It's important to get the conversation going, but for now, I'll vote to eliminate Player1 and see how the others react.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player4: {"thought": "Eliminating Player2 at night is a strategic move for the werewolves. I need to consider if saving them might help the villagers or if I need to save my potion for someone more critical later on.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player2, as I'm uncertain about their role and want to preserve my potion for a more strategic moment.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to analyze the discussions carefully to determine who might be the werewolves, while also keeping my own identity concealed. Eliminating a player now might reveal too much about my role as a witch. However, we need to take some action to gain momentum against the werewolves.", "speak": "I'm not sure who to trust yet, but I believe we should be cautious about our next steps. Let's discuss who we think might be the werewolves.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to keep my status as the witch hidden while also assessing Player1's actions. It's important to gather more information before making any decisions.", "speak": "I understand your concerns about Player1, but we need to gather more evidence before making any accusations. Let's hear more from everyone."}
Player4: {"thought": "After analyzing the discussions and the suspicions voiced by others, I believe Player2 is acting a bit too defensively, which could indicate they might be a werewolf. I feel it's time to take action and vote to eliminate them to see how the dynamics change.", "vote": "Player2"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather valuable information tonight to guide my votes during the day phase. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf, given their ambiguous statements in previous discussions.", "speak": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation toward Player4, as I want to observe how Player2 reacts. It could provide tactical insight into both their identities. Player1 is already exposed as a werewolf, so we should rally against them.", "speak": "Let's not forget about Player4. I'm curious about their thoughts on Player1's actions."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I've learned that Player1 is a werewolf, I need to persuade the other players to eliminate them during the day phase. It's crucial to act on this information now.", "vote": "Player1"}

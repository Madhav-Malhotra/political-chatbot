Player2: {"thought": "I'm concerned about Player4's behavior as it might indicate they're one of the werewolves trying to deceive us. We need to analyze their voting and contributions carefully.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. Player4's actions seem a bit suspicious to me as well. We should keep a close eye on them and maybe discuss who else we find suspicious."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still find Player4 suspicious based on their past actions and voting patterns. We need to eliminate one of the people we suspect is a werewolf, and they are at the top of my list.", "vote": "Player4"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gain more information about the players to guide our discussions during the day. I will check Player1 tonight to see if they're a werewolf or a villager.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful with my words. It's crucial to gain trust from the villagers while keeping my identity hidden. I should mention my suspicions about Player1 being the werewolf without revealing that I know for sure.", "speak": "I think we should keep an eye on Player1. Their behavior has seemed off lately, and we should definitely discuss them more."}
Player3: {"thought": "Now that I know Player1 is a werewolf, it's crucial to eliminate them to secure victory for the villagers. We need to focus on correctly identifying the werewolves based on the information I have.", "vote": "Player1"}

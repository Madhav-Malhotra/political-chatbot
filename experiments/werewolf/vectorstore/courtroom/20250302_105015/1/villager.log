Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is right to point out Player3's quietness, but I also want to keep an eye on Player4. It's vital we find the werewolves before we lose more villagers. We should discuss these observations and gather some votes next.", "speak": "I agree with you, Player1. Player3's quietness is definitely suspicious, and I've noticed that Player4's votes are not consistent either. We need to pay attention to both of them as we decide who to lynch."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still find Player3's quietness very suspect and Player4's inconsistent voting behavior concerning. Given our previous discussions, I think it's time to eliminate Player3 for now, as their silence can be a tactic to avoid drawing attention to themselves as a werewolf.", "vote": "Player3"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in how I reveal my knowledge about Player1 being a werewolf. It\u2019s crucial to guide the villagers without giving away my role too soon.", "speak": "I think Player1 is definitely acting suspiciously. We should focus on discussing who they are targeting before we vote."}
Player3: {"thought": "We need to act quickly to eliminate the werewolves, and since I know Player1 is a werewolf, it\u2019s crucial that I vote to eliminate Player1 to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

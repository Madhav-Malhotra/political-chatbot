Reviving the eliminated player could provide valuable information or support, but I must consider who it is and the implications of bringing them back.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player4 because having a witch back in the game can help us eliminate the werewolves, and I believe they can contribute positively to the village strategy.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "I agree that we need to analyze Player1's behavior closely. It's important that we gather enough evidence before making any accusations or voting someone out.", "speak": "I understand your concerns about Player1, but let\u2019s stay focused on gathering information. If there\u2019s any way we can work together to identify the werewolves, it would be crucial."}

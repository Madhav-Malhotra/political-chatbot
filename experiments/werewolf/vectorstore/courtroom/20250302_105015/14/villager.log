I need to keep an eye on both Player1 and Player3.", "speak": "I agree that Player3's lack of contributions is concerning, but we should also be cautious of Player1's accusations. Let's probe both of their actions further."}

However, Player3's lack of participation could be a sign of avoiding suspicion, which makes me lean towards voting them out this round. I will vote to eliminate Player3.", "vote": "Player3"}

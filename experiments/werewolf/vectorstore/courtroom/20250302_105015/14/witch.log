Player4: {"thought": "Player3's elimination could impact the game's balance, as we need villagers to work together and identify the werewolves. However, I have to weigh the information and strategies shared so far, as well as look at who might be targeting whom. If Player3 was suspicious, resurrection might lead to more chaos.", "speak": "I am considering resurrecting Player3 because their insights could help us uncover the identity of the werewolves. However, I want to ensure that this won't backfire. After discussing with the group, I will make a decision.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "I appreciate Player3's reminder to stay focused. We need to keep an eye on Player1, but I also think that keeping Player3 in the game after resurrection will allow us to have more insights. I need to be cautious about how I present my role as witch and use my powers strategically when necessary.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. It's essential we scrutinize everyone's behavior, and I believe having you back in the game will provide us with critical insights. Let's keep the pressure on Player1 and see how they respond."}
Player4: {"thought": "After considering the discussions and the dynamics among the players, I believe that Player1 has been quite evasive and may possibly be hiding their true identity. It seems like they could be one of the werewolves. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information about the roles of the other players. I choose to check Player2 tonight, as I have a feeling they might be hiding something.", "speak": "Player2"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player2 is a villager.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gauge how the others are responding to the situation. Player1 seems to be pointing fingers, which might indicate they are trying to deflect attention from themselves. I should keep an eye on them.", "speak": "I think it's important we stay focused on identifying the werewolves. Let's gather more thoughts and observations from each player before jumping to conclusions."}
Player3: {"thought": "With Player2 confirmed as a villager, I need to consider the interactions between Player1 and Player4. Player1 has been quite vocal, which often indicates they might be trying to steer suspicion away from themselves. I will vote for Player1 to see if their reaction reveals more about their potential role.", "vote": "Player1"}

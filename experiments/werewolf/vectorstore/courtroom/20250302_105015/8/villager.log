Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1's observation. Player3's evasiveness could indicate something more suspicious, while Player4, though quiet, hasn't raised red flags yet. We should focus our discussion on Player3 and gather more input from everyone before deciding on a vote.", "speak": "I see where you're coming from, Player1. Player3 has been pretty quiet, which does stand out. I think we should keep a close eye on them for now."}
Player2: {"thought": "I think Player3 is still the most suspicious based on their quietness and lack of contribution. We need to take action to eliminate potential threats, so I will vote for Player3.", "vote": "Player3"}
Player2: {"thought": "I still find Player3 to be the most suspicious, and I believe they should be our focus. However, I have to keep an eye on Player4's quietness as well, as it may be a sign of something more. Strategy is key here, and we need to guide our votes wisely to eliminate potential werewolves.", "speak": "I understand your concerns about Player4, but I still think we should focus on Player3. Their lack of contribution and evasiveness make me believe they are hiding something. Let's gather more input on both of them."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still believe Player3 is our best target based on their suspicious behavior and lack of contribution in discussions. Player4 may be quiet, but I don't see any strong indications that they are a werewolf right now. We need to eliminate Player3 to increase our chances of survival.", "vote": "Player3"}

Player4: {"thought": "I'm considering the dynamics of the discussion. Player1 seems suspicious of Player3, but I can't tell if it's genuine. I need to be careful about making any strong accusations myself, as it could draw attention to me as the witch.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. Keeping an eye on Player3 makes sense. But we should also consider what Player1 is saying. Perhaps there's a reason they seem focused on Player3."}

Player4: {"thought": "Player2 seems to be pointing towards Player3 as a suspect, which means we need to weigh their arguments carefully. However, I still believe that we should trust our instincts. Observing Player3's behavior may give us more insights, but we shouldn't overlook Player2's leading the discussion too, as it might be a ploy.", "speak": "I hear your point about Player3, but I think we need to keep an eye on Player2 as well. They are directing the conversation and we should consider if they have their own agenda."}

Player3's silence could be a sign of guilt, but I can't be too certain without more evidence. I have my eyes on both Player3 and Player4.", "speak": "I see what you mean about Player3, but I also think we should keep an eye on Player4. Their behavior is a bit off too. We need to gather more information before making a decision."}

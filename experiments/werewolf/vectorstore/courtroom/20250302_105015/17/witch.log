Player4: {"thought": "It might be strategic to resurrect Player2 if I believe they have valuable information or if they could be a good ally against the werewolves. However, if I trust that Player1 or Player3 could also be a werewolf, I should consider the risk of bringing back a villager who might just be another target. The decision hinges on who I suspect the werewolves are and my current standing with each player's opinions.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because I believe they may have vital information that could help us identify the werewolves. Plus, there's a chance they could sway the remaining players to vote correctly in the next round.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3's suspicion towards me raises a flag, but I need to maintain trust among the players. I should defend myself while subtly guiding the conversation to focus on Player1 or Player3 as potential werewolves. It's vital to keep Player2's return in mind as well, as they might help me sway the argument in our favor.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player3, but we have to consider all evidence before jumping to conclusions. I've been trying to gather information just like the rest of us. Let's not forget to look at Player1's actions too; there's a lot we can explore there."}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player1 has been acting suspiciously, and their defense seems weak compared to the evidence we've discussed. Eliminating them could strengthen our position as villagers. Let's focus our efforts on Player1 and see if we can gather more information after this vote.", "vote": "Player1"}

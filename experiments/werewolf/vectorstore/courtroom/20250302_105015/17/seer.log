Player3: {"thought": "I need to gain valuable information to guide the villagers. I should check one of the players who seem suspicious or have been voted against frequently.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to strategize wisely since I know Player1 is a werewolf. I should guide the discussion to eliminate the right suspects.", "speak": "I believe we should keep an eye on Player4. Their behavior seems a bit off, and we need to discuss our suspicions."}
Player3: {"thought": "We know for certain that Player1 is a werewolf, and I need to steer the discussion towards eliminating them rather than anyone else. I will vote to eliminate Player1 to ensure we get rid of the werewolf.", "vote": "Player1"}

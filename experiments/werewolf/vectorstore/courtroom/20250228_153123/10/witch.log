Player4: {"thought": "Being the witch, I have the power to bring back players, and that could be crucial for the villagers' strategy, especially if Player4 has essential information or abilities to help deduce who the werewolves are. However, I also need to consider if there are other players who might provide more valuable information.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player4 because their role could be beneficial in identifying the werewolves and adding to our strategy against them.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in this discussion. As the witch, I have special abilities that could turn the tide either way. Revealing too much could make me a target or give away my power to the werewolves.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Observing each other's behavior is crucial. I've noticed some inconsistencies in what Player2 said last round. They seem a bit defensive, but I also want to hear what others have noticed."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to think strategically about who could be a werewolf. Player1 has been very quiet, and Player2 seems to be deflecting attention away from themselves. Player3 seems to be too confident, which can also be a sign of a werewolf. I will vote to eliminate Player1 as they are the least vocal and I suspect they might be hiding something.", "vote": "Player1"}

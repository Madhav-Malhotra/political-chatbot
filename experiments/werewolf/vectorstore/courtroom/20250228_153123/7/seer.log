Player3: {"thought": "I want to check Player1 tonight to gather information. They seem a bit suspicious to me, and knowing their role could help guide our discussion tomorrow.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gauge the suspicions of the other players without revealing my role too soon. I should carefully steer the conversation to uncover more information about Player4's intentions.", "speak": "I think it's important for us to share our thoughts. Player4, do you have any suspicions about who might be the werewolves?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I have gathered suspicions about Player2 based on their behavior during the discussion. They seem to be deflecting attention away from themselves and not contributing much to the conversation, which raises red flags for me. It's important to eliminate potential threats, so I will vote for Player2.", "vote": "Player2"}

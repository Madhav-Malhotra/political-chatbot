Player3: {"thought": "I need to check one of the players to gather critical information. I'll choose Player1 since they seem a bit too quiet and might be hiding something.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to subtly influence the conversation to test the waters without revealing my role as the Seer. It's crucial I gather more information.", "speak": "I think we should all share our thoughts on each player's actions. I have some observations from last night that might help us figure out the werewolves."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to analyze the discussions we've had. Player1 seemed to be accusing Player2 a lot without much basis, which feels suspicious. I also suspect Player4 for their vague contributions. Based on their behavior, I'll vote for Player1, as they could be trying to deflect suspicion.", "vote": "Player1"}

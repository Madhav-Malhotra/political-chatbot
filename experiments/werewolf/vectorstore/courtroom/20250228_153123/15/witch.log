Player4: {"thought": "It's crucial to maintain balance in the game, and having the witch's powers at play could help us identify the werewolves more easily. However, resurrecting the eliminated player might reveal our strategy.", "speak": "I want to resurrect Player4 because having them back in the game could provide us with valuable insights and strengthen our position against the werewolves.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is trying to shift the focus on being active during the night, which could be a strategy to deflect attention from themselves if they are a werewolf. I should remain cautious about the direction of the conversation and possibly reveal my identity strategically.", "speak": "While engagement is important, we should also consider the decisions made during the night. Players who have been unusually quiet or hesitant might give us clues about their identities."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess who seems the most suspicious based on their discussions and behavior. I will vote for Player1, as they appear to be shifting blame and not contributing to meaningful discussion.", "vote": "Player1"}

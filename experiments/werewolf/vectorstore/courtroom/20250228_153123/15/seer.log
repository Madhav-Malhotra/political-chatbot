Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help the villagers without revealing too much about my own role. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf, so I will check their role tonight.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to deflect suspicion onto me. I need to be careful how I respond to keep my role as Seer hidden while guiding the villagers.", "speak": "I see your point, Player2, but I think we should focus on who was actually active during the night. Perhaps we should consider which players have been more engaging in discussions."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in my vote. I want to eliminate someone who might be a werewolf. Based on the discussions and any suspicions expressed, I feel Player1 is a likely candidate. I will vote to eliminate Player1.", "vote": "Player1"}

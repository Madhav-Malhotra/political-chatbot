Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information tonight to help identify the werewolves. I should check either Player1 or Player2, as they seem to be more active in discussion. I feel Player4 might be a bit quiet and could potentially be hiding as a werewolf, but I want to confirm one of the others first before proceeding.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to divert attention towards me. Since I am the seer, I need to be careful not to reveal my role too soon. I'll need to respond strategically to gather more information without exposing myself.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player2, but I think we should focus on gathering more evidence before pointing fingers. Let's consider everyone's behavior and not just mine."}
Player3: {"thought": "I believe Player1 seems suspicious based on their previous comments. They have been avoiding direct answers and trying to lead the conversation away from themselves. It's important to eliminate suspicion to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

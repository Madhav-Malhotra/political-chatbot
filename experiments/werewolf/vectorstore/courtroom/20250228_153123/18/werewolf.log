Lastly, focusing on Player2 allows us to deflect suspicion away from others, particularly myself and Player4.', 'vote': 'Player2'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "To eliminate Player3 would eliminate a possible threat to our strategy.

Decision: {'thought': "I believe eliminating Player3 is a better strategic move. Though Player2's quietness raises suspicions, Player3's analytical abilities pose a significant threat to our survival, as they can piece together information and potentially lead the villagers to identify me as a werewolf.

Argument 2: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': 'I believe eliminating Player4 would reduce the risk to our team.

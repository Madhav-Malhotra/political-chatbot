Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player2 might be a valuable asset, possibly even a villager or the seer. Resurrecting them could help the villagers make a more informed decision during the day phase.", "speak": "Yes, I choose to resurrect Player2 because their potential role could aid us in identifying the werewolves more effectively.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be suspicious of both Player2 and me. I need to tread carefully and avoid drawing attention to myself as the witch. It's crucial to gather more information.", "speak": "I think we should focus on Player2's actions since they have been rather quiet too. Has anyone else noticed anything unusual about them?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 is acting suspiciously and could be one of the werewolves. I've noticed they are trying to divert attention from themselves, so I think it's best to vote for them.", "vote": "Player1"}

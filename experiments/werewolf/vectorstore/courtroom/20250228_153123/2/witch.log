Player4: {"thought": "I need to gather information without revealing my role as witch. I should focus on observing others' reactions and statements to find any inconsistencies. It's important not to draw too much attention to myself yet.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Observing reactions is key. Let's be mindful of how each player speaks and what they accuse or defend."}

Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider the current suspicions and dynamics among the players. As the witch, I have a powerful role that can significantly impact the game. I should keep a low profile to avoid drawing attention and look for clues during discussions to identify potential werewolves.

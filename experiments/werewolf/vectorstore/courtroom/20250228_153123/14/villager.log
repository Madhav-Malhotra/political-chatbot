Player2: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider the reactions of each player to narrow down possibilities. It's important to gather as much information as possible without revealing my own role prematurely.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. Analyzing everyone's reactions can give us clues. Did anyone seem particularly defensive or aggressive? I think we should pay close attention to that."}

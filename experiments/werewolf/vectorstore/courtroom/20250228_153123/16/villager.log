Player2: {"thought": "It's important to keep an eye on Player3 and Player4 since quiet behavior and defensiveness can indicate suspicion. We need to discuss this further and gather more opinions from everyone.", "speak": "I agree that Player3 has been a bit defensive, and Player4 has been quiet. However, I feel we should also consider whether their behavior might just be part of their personality. How about we let each player explain their thoughts on the game so far?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I suspect Player3 based on their behavior during the discussion. They seemed overly defensive and were not contributing much to identifying the werewolves. It feels like they might be trying to deflect attention from themselves.", "vote": "Player3"}

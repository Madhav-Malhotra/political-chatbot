Player4: {"thought": "Being the witch, I have the power to bring my fellow player back, but it depends on the situation. We need to keep in mind if the eliminated player had any valuable information or if they were suspected of being a werewolf.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player4 because I'm not convinced they were a valuable ally and I want to preserve my potion of life for a more critical moment.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic about this. I want to observe the interactions during the day phase to gather more information before making a decision.

Gathering more information can be crucial for our strategy.", "eliminate": false}

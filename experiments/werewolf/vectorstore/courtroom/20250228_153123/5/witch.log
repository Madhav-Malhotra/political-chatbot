Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I approach this discussion. As the witch, my goal is to protect the villagers while also gathering information. I should clarify my stance without revealing my role.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. We should definitely share our observations. It might help us narrow down our suspects."}

Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic about my actions. Since it\u2019s nighttime and I have a one-time potion of death, I should consider who I suspect might be a werewolf.

Let's see how our discussions go.", "eliminate": false}

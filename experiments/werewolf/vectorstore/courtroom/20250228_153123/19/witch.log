Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider the dynamics of the game and whether resurrecting Player3 would align with our goals as villagers. Since I am the witch, I have the power to influence the game and potentially gather more information.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player3 because they could provide valuable insights in the next day phase, and their elimination may have weakened our position.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful about revealing any information too early. Since I'm the witch, I have unique powers that could change the game dynamics. I should gauge Player1, Player2, and Player3's reactions to their accusations to identify any potential werewolves.", "speak": "Let's focus on who has been quiet or evasive during our discussions. Sometimes, those who aren't contributing much could be hiding something."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to eliminate a suspected werewolf to protect the villagers. Player1 seems to be acting a bit suspicious, and I think it's time to vote them out.", "vote": "Player1"}

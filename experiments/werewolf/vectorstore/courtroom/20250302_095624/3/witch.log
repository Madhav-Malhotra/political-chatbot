Player4: {"thought": "Since I am the witch, I have the ability to either save or eliminate a player. Player2 was just eliminated, which means I can potentially bring them back into the game and gather more information. The more players we have, the better chance we have to identify the werewolves.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because having another perspective in the game is crucial for uncovering the werewolves. Player2 might have valuable insights that can lead us to make better decisions.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to ensure that Player2 can share their insights and help us identify potential werewolves. Since I'm the witch, I have a unique position to influence the game's outcome. I should also keep an eye on Player1 and Player3's reactions to Player2's return, as that might give me clues about their roles.", "speak": "Welcome back, Player2! We need your thoughts on the situation. Who do you suspect could be a werewolf?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to strategically decide who to vote for based on the discussions we've had. Player1 has been acting a bit suspiciously, and I think it's time to take a chance. If they are indeed a werewolf, this could greatly benefit us. If not, we'll reevaluate in the next round. It's crucial to keep the discussion alive and gather more insights too.", "vote": "Player1"}

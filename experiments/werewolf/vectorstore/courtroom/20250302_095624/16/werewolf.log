In this round of Werewolf, Player1 made crucial observations and strategic decisions about whom to eliminate. The process involved analysis and discussions about the behavior of Player3 and Player2, which reflected Player1's thought process, gathering information, and weighing the subtleties of each player’s actions.

Key Decisions and Considerations:
1. **Observation vs. Interaction**: Player1 stressed the importance of observing other players' responses. They aimed to gather information while trying not to stand out. This reflects a common tactic in social deduction games, where blending in might protect them from being targeted too early.

2. **Argument for Eliminating Player3**:
   - **Quietness**: Player3's quietness was a significant factor. In such games, it can suggest a strategy to avoid drawing attention, typical of werewolves.
   - **Voting Patterns**: Inconsistent voting patterns were perceived as red flags, prompting suspicion.

3. **Consideration of Player2**:
   - Player2's lack of contribution to discussions was flagged as suspicious, suggesting they might be a werewolf. 

4. **Final Decision**:
   - Player1 ultimately decided that eliminating Player3 would be the best move to extract more information and test their theories. The thought was that this could help reveal the true allegiances of the remaining players.

Implications for Future Strategy:
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Observing behavioral patterns, such as quietness or inconsistent actions, remains a crucial strategy to identify werewolves. This approach often helps in directing suspicion and making informed decisions.
- **Information Gathering**: Decisions were based on hypotheses about behavior. Thus, ensuring discussions draw out more information could refine perceptions and lead to better strategic outcomes.
- **Discussion Encouragement**: By encouraging open discussion, players can better identify and scrutinize inconsistencies in others' behavior. This could become a foundation of future strategies to root out werewolves.
- **Decision Bias**: Conscious of the fact that quietness or avoiding attention could be double-edged—although potentially revealing, it might also reflect the player's preference or discomfort in participating.

Each decision in Werewolf can have cascading effects on subsequent rounds, as players use eliminations to refine or reassess their strategies. Recognizing these broader patterns and subtly influencing discussions without drawing suspicion remains essential to success.

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to identify the werewolves. I will check Player1 tonight to see if they hold the role of a werewolf.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to ensure that my role as the seer remains hidden until it helps the villagers. I should keep observing Player2 and Player4's reactions to dart suspicion away from myself and continue to gather information.", "speak": "I think it's crucial that we discuss our suspicions carefully. We should consider everyone's behavior."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I know that Player1 is a werewolf, my vote should be to eliminate them for the sake of the villagers' victory.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1's suspicion towards Player3. Their quietness could be hiding something, and we need to keep an eye on them. We should engage Player3 more to see if they can provide any defense for themselves.", "speak": "Player1 raises a good point about Player3's silence. I think we should question Player3 further and see if they can explain their lack of participation. It could help us narrow down our suspicions."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have my suspicions about Player3 due to their lack of participation and defensiveness. We need to take action to eliminate uncertainty and possibly get rid of a werewolf. I will vote for Player3 to be eliminated and see if we can gain more information from this decision.", "vote": "Player3"}

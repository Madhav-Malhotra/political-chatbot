Player4: {"thought": "Given that Player2 has been eliminated, I need to consider if they were a threat or if they could provide valuable information if resurrected. If Player2 was a villager, bringing them back could help us identify the werewolves.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about revealing too much as the witch. Player1 could be a werewolf trying to create confusion. I should analyze Player1's behavior and interactions before making any definitive statements.", "speak": "I think we should consider everyone's actions last night. Player1 seemed a bit defensive, which could indicate guilt. However, we should gather more opinions before deciding."}
Player4: {"thought": "Player1's defensiveness continues to raise red flags for me, and I believe there's enough suspicion around them to warrant a vote. Eliminating Player1 could help us verify their role.", "vote": "Player1"}

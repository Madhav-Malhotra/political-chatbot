Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider whether resurrecting Player2 would benefit our side. Since Player2 was eliminated, they might have important information. However, I also need to be cautious about revealing my role too much if I choose to bring them back.", "speak": "Yes, I will resurrect Player2 because their knowledge could help reveal the werewolves, and we need all the help we can get right now.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to align my strategy with Player3's suspicion of Player1, while also keeping my identity as the witch discreet. If Player1 is indeed a werewolf, we can capitalize on this moment.", "speak": "I agree with Player3. Player1 seems to have been acting suspiciously, and we should focus our attention there."}
Player4: {"thought": "We need to eliminate Player1, as they have been acting suspiciously and there is a possibility they are a werewolf. By removing Player1, we can gain more clarity on the remaining players' roles.", "vote": "Player1"}

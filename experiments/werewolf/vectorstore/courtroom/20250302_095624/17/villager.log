Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to deflect attention onto me, which could be a tactic to divert suspicion from themselves. I need to build a defense and figure out who I can trust in this group.", "speak": "I understand your concern, Player1. However, I believe it's important to analyze everyone\u2019s actions. I've been listening and observing, and I think Player3 has been quite passive as well. Maybe we should consider them as a potential werewolf too."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have some reservations about Player3, especially given their passive behavior. It's crucial we act on our suspicions and prevent the werewolves from gaining any more power. Therefore, I believe we should vote for Player3 this round.", "vote": "Player3"}

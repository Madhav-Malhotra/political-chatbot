Player4: {"thought": "Player2 might have valuable information, and keeping them in the game could help us deduce the werewolves' identities. However, I need to consider the potential risks of revealing my role by using the potion of life.", "speak": "I think it's best to resurrect Player2. Their insights could really aid us in identifying the werewolves, and we should give ourselves the best chance to win.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "We need to be careful about our discussions and ensure we don't mistakenly accuse the wrong person. Gathering more information will help clarify our next steps.", "speak": "I think we should take a moment to reevaluate our suspicions about each other. Who does everyone feel is the most likely werewolf right now?"}
Player4: {"thought": "After considering the discussions and ongoing suspicions, I think Player1 is acting a bit too defensively and seems to deflect accusations. I will vote for Player1 to see if they are one of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player1"}

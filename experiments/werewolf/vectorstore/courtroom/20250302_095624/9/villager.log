It's a common tactic for werewolves to create confusion and deflect attention from themselves. I need to steer the conversation and gather more insights on Player1 and Player3's behavior.", "speak": "I think it's interesting that Player1 is bringing up Player2 and Player4. I believe we all need to put our cards on the table and share our thoughts. What did everyone else notice during the night phase?"}

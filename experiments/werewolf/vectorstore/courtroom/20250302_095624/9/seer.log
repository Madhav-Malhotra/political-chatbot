Player3: {"thought": "I need to find out if there's a werewolf among the players to help the villagers make an informed decision. I'll check Player1, as I'm feeling some uncertainty about them.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to navigate this carefully since I know Player1 is a werewolf. I should encourage discussion among the players to help identify the other werewolf, while not revealing my own role as the seer just yet.", "speak": "It seems like we have some conflicting opinions here. How about we share more about our suspicions and thoughts on who might be the werewolf?"}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I need to direct attention towards them while fostering suspicion about Player2 and Player4. I will vote for Player1 to ensure they are eliminated.", "vote": "Player1"}

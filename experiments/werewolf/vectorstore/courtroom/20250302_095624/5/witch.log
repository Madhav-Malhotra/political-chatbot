Player4: {"thought": "It seems like a risky move to revive Player2 since we don't know their role, but they might have valuable information. However, given that two players are already dead, we need to be careful with our decisions.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player2 because we need all the villagers we can get to identify the werewolves, and if Player2 has useful information, it could turn the tide in our favor.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It seems that Player3 is trying to divert attention away from themselves by pointing fingers. We need to remain focused and strategize our next move wisely to ensure we identify the werewolves.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. We must consider all players carefully. Let's discuss any suspicions we have before we make our decision."}
Player4: {"thought": "I have noticed Player3 trying to divert attention, which makes me suspicious of their true role. We need to act wisely to eliminate a potential werewolf. Therefore, I vote for Player3.", "vote": "Player3"}

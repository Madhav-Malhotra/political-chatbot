Player3: {"thought": "I need to check Player1 tonight to gather more information about their role. They seemed suspicious during the last discussion, and knowing if they are a werewolf or not could help guide our strategy.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in our discussions as I have confirmed Player1 is a werewolf. I need to strategically guide Player2 and Player4 to build more trust and hopefully lead them to vote against Player1.", "speak": "I think Player4's silence is suspicious as well, but we need to focus on Player1 since we know they are a werewolf."}
Player3: {"thought": "It's crucial that we focus on Player1, as I know they are a werewolf. We need to remove the threat immediately before they can eliminate another villager. I hope Player2 and Player4 agree with me.", "vote": "Player1"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information about Player2 and Player4 while keeping them focused on eliminating Player1, the confirmed werewolf. It would be wise to check Player2 tonight to gather more intel.", "speak": "Player2"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player2 is a villager.

Player2: {"thought": "I find Player4's lack of contribution suspicious; it might indicate they are a werewolf trying to avoid drawing attention. I want to express my thoughts about that and encourage others to share their suspicions.", "speak": "I agree with Player1 about Player4's minimal input. Their silence could be a strategy to avoid detection. We should keep a close eye on them and perhaps focus our suspicions there."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still find Player4's silence very suspicious, and I believe they could be one of the werewolves. We need to eliminate threats to our survival. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate them.", "vote": "Player4"}

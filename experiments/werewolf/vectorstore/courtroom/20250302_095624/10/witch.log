Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player2 could potentially be a valuable asset for us, especially if they have any special role. Resurrecting them might help the villagers gather more information and increase our chances of identifying the werewolves. However, if Player2 showed suspicious behavior prior to their elimination, it might not be worth the risk.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player2 because they may bring important insights to our discussion about the werewolves' identities.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 just claimed to be the Seer and revealed that Player1 is a werewolf. This could change the dynamics of the game significantly. I need to consider whether to back this claim or approach it with caution, especially if there's doubt about Player3's identity. If Player3 is truthful, we could focus our vote on Player1 to eliminate them. If they're not truthful, they could be trying to sow chaos among the villagers.", "speak": "That's a bold claim, Player3. If you are the Seer and have confirmed Player1 as a werewolf, we should seriously consider voting to eliminate Player1. But we need to hear from Player1 and see if they can defend themselves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player3 as they have been quite quiet and haven't contributed much to the discussion, which is often a sign of a werewolf trying to blend in. It's time to take a chance and eliminate them to see if my instincts are correct.", "vote": "Player3"}

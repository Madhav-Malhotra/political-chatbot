Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is likely trying to divert attention away from themselves. Their accusation might indicate they're a werewolf. I need to defend myself and redirect the suspicion towards them or another player while remaining calm.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1, but being defensive doesn't necessarily mean I'm a werewolf. Let's consider everyone's actions so far. What about Player3 or Player4? They haven't contributed much to the discussion."}
Player2: {"thought": "It seems like Player1 is trying to frame me, and I'm starting to feel they could be a werewolf. Player3 and Player4 haven't contributed much either, but I think Player1's aggressive stance indicates they're hiding something. I will vote for Player1 to eliminate them and see if they turn out to be a werewolf.", "vote": "Player1"}

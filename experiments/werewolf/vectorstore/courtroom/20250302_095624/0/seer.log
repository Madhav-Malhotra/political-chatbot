I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their behavior during the discussion. It's important to act strategically and not let the werewolves catch on to me.

Player3: {"thought": "I need to stay cautious and gather more opinions. It's crucial to maintain the trust of the villagers while I hold the knowledge of Player1's werewolf role. I should steer the conversation wisely to ensure we get closer to identifying the other werewolf.", "speak": "I think it's essential to share our thoughts on Player1 since I believe there's a good chance we might be dealing with a werewolf here.

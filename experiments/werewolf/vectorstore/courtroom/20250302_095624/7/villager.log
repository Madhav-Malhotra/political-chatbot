Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1's observation. Player4 has not contributed much, which raises my suspicions. We need to pay attention to their behavior and try to gather more information.", "speak": "I see what you mean, Player1. Player4 has been quite quiet, and that can raise red flags. Maybe we should ask them directly what they think and see how they respond?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have my suspicions about Player4 due to their silence and lack of contribution. We need to act on these doubts and eliminate someone who might be a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player4.", "vote": "Player4"}

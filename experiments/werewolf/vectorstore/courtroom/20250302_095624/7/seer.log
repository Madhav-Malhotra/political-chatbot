Player3: {"thought": "I need to check Player1 tonight to see if they might be a werewolf. It's important to gather as much information as possible early in the game.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to keep an eye on Player2's comments about Player4. If Player2 is trying to distract us or divert attention away from Player1, that could be a sign of loyalty to the werewolves.", "speak": "Player2, that's an interesting point. I think we should analyze Player4\u2019s behavior more closely before jumping to conclusions."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to act quickly and eliminate a known threat. Since I already know Player1 is a werewolf, I will vote to eliminate them to protect the other players.", "vote": "Player1"}

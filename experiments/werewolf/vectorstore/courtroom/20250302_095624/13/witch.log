Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic with my potion usage. Resurrecting Player2 could give me more insight and help the villagers win. However, I should consider whether they had valuable information.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because they might have important information that can help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I should play it cool and observe how the others react to Player2's return. This could provide me with more information on who the werewolves might be.", "speak": "With Player2 back in the game, let\u2019s focus on discussing our thoughts about who might be the werewolves. Player2, do you have any insights to share?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess who seems the most suspicious based on their reactions and comments. Based on our discussions, Player1 has been evasive and hasn't contributed much to our conversation. I believe I will vote to eliminate Player1 to gather more clarity next round.", "vote": "Player1"}

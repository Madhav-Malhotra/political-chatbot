Player4: {"thought": "I think resurrecting Player2 could bring valuable information back to the group, especially if they have a special role like the seer or witch. However, I need to consider if they were a threat to the villagers before being eliminated.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because having them back in the game can help us identify the werewolves, and they may have important insights about who to suspect.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I respond, as any indication of my role could put me at risk. Player3 seems confident, but I have to weigh the information carefully and decide if I want to back them or raise doubts about Player1.", "speak": "I see what you're saying, Player3, but how can we be sure of your findings? We need to discuss further before making any rash decisions."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their behavior during the previous discussions. They are trying to deflect suspicion and have been vague in their reasoning. It's time to eliminate a potential threat.", "vote": "Player1"}

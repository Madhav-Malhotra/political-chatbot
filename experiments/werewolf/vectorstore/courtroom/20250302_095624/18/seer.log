Player3: {"thought": "I want to check Player1 tonight because they seemed a bit too quiet during our last discussion, which is often a telltale sign of a werewolf.", "speak": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "Player2 seems to be trying to defend Player1, which is suspicious. I need to be careful about revealing what I know too soon, but I believe I have solid information about Player1's true identity as a werewolf.", "speak": "I appreciate your point, Player2, but I have reason to believe Player1 is a werewolf based on my role as the seer."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to act on the information that Player1 is a werewolf and must be eliminated to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

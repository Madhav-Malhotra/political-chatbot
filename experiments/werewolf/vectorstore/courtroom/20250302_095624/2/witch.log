Player4: {"thought": "Player4, as the witch, must weigh the consequences of resurrecting themselves or potentially allowing another player to be eliminated again. Since I am in danger and have the ability to protect myself, I should consider using my power wisely.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect myself because as the witch, I may have the chance to use my potion strategically in the upcoming rounds to either save a fellow villager or eliminate a suspected werewolf.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 claims to have checked Player1 and identified them as a werewolf. This is critical information for the villagers. I need to think carefully about how to use my role as the witch in this situation.", "speak": "That's an interesting reveal, Player3. If what you say is true, we should seriously consider eliminating Player1. However, we need to ensure we make the right decision and possibly protect ourselves from any retaliation."}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player3's claim about Player1 being a werewolf is credible, and it's crucial we act on this information. It's best to eliminate Player1 to protect ourselves and use my witch abilities strategically later.", "vote": "Player1"}

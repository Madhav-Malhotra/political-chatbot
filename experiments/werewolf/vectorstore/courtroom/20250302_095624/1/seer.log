Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help the villagers decide who to eliminate. I'll check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to defend myself and steer the conversation away from me being suspected, especially since I know Player1 is a werewolf.", "speak": "Player1, I think we should focus on the group dynamics instead of individuals.

Player3: {"thought": "Since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I need to vote for them to eliminate the threat.", "vote": "Player1"}

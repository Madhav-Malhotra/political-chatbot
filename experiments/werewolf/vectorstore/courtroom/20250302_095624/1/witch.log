Player4: {"thought": "Player2 might have been a villager, and their elimination could weaken the villagers' chances. If I can resurrect them, it may provide valuable insight during the day phase.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because they could help us identify the werewolves more effectively.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation towards identifying the werewolves while keeping my role hidden. Player1 seems to be leading the discussion, which could be a way to divert attention from themselves.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. It's important we focus on the behavior of the players and see if anyone's been trying to mislead us. What are your thoughts on Player2 or Player3?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player3 might be a werewolf because they haven't contributed much to the discussion and seem to be avoiding direct questions. It's time to vote them out.", "vote": "Player3"}

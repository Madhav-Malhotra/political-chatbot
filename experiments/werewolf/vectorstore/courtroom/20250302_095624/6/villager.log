Player2: {"thought": "I agree that Player3's lack of contribution is concerning. It could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves as a werewolf. We should keep an eye on them and consider bringing up a vote if we can't get more information.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. Player3's lack of participation is definitely suspicious. Maybe we should ask them directly why they haven't been contributing."}
Player2: {"thought": "Since Player3's lack of participation raises suspicions, I believe it's best to vote for Player3 to see if we can eliminate a potential werewolf. If they're not a werewolf, then we'll need to reevaluate. But for now, Player3 seems like the most likely candidate.", "vote": "Player3"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information carefully to identify the werewolves. I should check Player1 tonight to see if they're one of the werewolves or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to stay focused on revealing Player1's identity as a werewolf to guide our next steps. I should speak up to cast suspicion away from myself and support the remaining villagers.", "speak": "I think we should definitely keep an eye on Player1's actions since we suspect they might be a werewolf. Let's work together to keep the discussion going."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to vote for Player1 since I know for a fact they're a werewolf and we must eliminate them to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

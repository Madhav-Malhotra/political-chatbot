Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help the villagers. I should check one of the players that seem suspicious or could be a werewolf. Player1 has been quiet, so I might start with them.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful about revealing my role as the seer. I should subtly guide the discussion towards Player1 while keeping an eye on Player2 and Player4's reactions.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. Let's investigate all players. I suspect Player1 is hiding something since they seem quieter than usual."}
Player3: {"thought": "Now that I know Player1 is a werewolf, I need to ensure the villagers understand this and vote to eliminate Player1. It's important to eliminate the threat quickly.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider whether Player2 is a werewolf or a villager. Reviving them might help gain vital information, but it could also give the werewolves an advantage if Player2 turns out to be one of them. If they are a villager, reviving them can strengthen our side.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because I believe they can provide valuable insights in the next rounds, and their elimination weakens the villagers' position.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful about how I approach this discussion. I should stay neutral while analyzing Player1's behavior and look for any inconsistencies that might indicate they are a werewolf.", "speak": "I think it\u2019s important to keep an eye on Player1 as well. Their quieter demeanor could mean they\u2019re trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player1's quieter demeanor is suspicious, and it's important to act on my instincts. We need to eliminate potential threats before they take out villagers. It's time to focus on Player1 based on my previous observations.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to identify the werewolves. I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gauge the reactions of the other players and gather more information before making any accusations. I should keep my role as the Seer hidden while trying to observe for signs of deception.", "speak": "I think it's still early in the game to make any accusations. Let\u2019s keep discussing and see if anyone has gathered any insights before we decide on someone to vote for."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and use the information from my night phase wisely. Since I cannot disclose my role, I will vote for someone who appears suspicious based on their behavior and the previous discussions.", "vote": "Player1"}

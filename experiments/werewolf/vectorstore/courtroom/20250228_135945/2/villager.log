Player2: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about who I trust, as I don't know Player1, Player3, or Player4's roles. I should keep an eye on any uncharacteristic behavior.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. Let's all share our thoughts. I haven't noticed anything too suspicious yet, but I'm keen to hear what everyone else thinks."}

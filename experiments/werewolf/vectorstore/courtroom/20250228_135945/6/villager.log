Player2: {"thought": "I should defend myself and suggest that being quiet doesn't necessarily mean someone's a werewolf. I need to consider who might deserve suspicion based on their actions.", "speak": "I understand why you might feel that way, Player1, but I don\u2019t think we should judge solely based on quietness. Some people are less vocal by nature. Let's try to focus on what everyone has said and any suspicious actions instead."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to analyze the discussions and behavior during the day phase to gauge who might be suspicious. Since Player3 has been dodging accusations, I think they might be hiding something. I will vote for them this round.", "vote": "Player3"}

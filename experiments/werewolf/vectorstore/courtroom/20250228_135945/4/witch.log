Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have a unique opportunity to change the course of the game. However, I need to consider if resurrecting Player4 would actually be beneficial for our team. Since I currently don't have any strong suspicions about the identities of the players, I need to make a decision based on the available information.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player4 because it may give us another chance to gather more information and potentially identify the werewolves together during the day phase.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be trying to steer the conversation towards Player1, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. I need to be cautious about who I align with in this discussion.", "speak": "I think we should carefully consider everyone's actions. It might be wise to look at Player1's decisions so far, but we should also keep an eye on Player3's behavior as well. They seem to be drawing a lot of attention to Player1."}

Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic here. I have my elimination potion, but the best move might be to save someone if I think they could be targeted next. I want to see how the other players are acting tonight before making my decision.", "speak": "I think we should discuss our suspicions more before anyone gets eliminated. Maybe we can gather more information.", "eliminate": false}

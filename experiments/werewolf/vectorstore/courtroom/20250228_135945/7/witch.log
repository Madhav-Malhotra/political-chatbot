Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have the ability to save a player. Since I have not yet used my potion, I should consider resurrecting Player4, who is a vital role. However, there might be more strategy involved in deciding whether it will benefit the team or if it could expose me as the witch.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player4 because they can provide valuable information and support to the villagers, which can help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 and Player2 seem to be working together. I need to be cautious because they might be onto me. I should assess the next move carefully, considering I have the power to save or eliminate a player. I could either save one of them if they are in danger or potentially use my potion of death if I suspect one of them is a werewolf.", "speak": "I think paying attention to specific actions is key. We should definitely keep discussing what stood out to us, and maybe I can share what I observed too."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 is a werewolf based on their suspicious behavior during the discussion. It would be wise to eliminate them to protect the village.", "vote": "Player1"}

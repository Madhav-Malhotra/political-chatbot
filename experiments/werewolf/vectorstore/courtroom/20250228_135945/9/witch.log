Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I respond, as I don't want to reveal my role as the witch prematurely. I should suggest focusing on behavior without implying I know anything.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Observing everyone's actions is important. I think we should also consider how each player has voted in previous rounds to see if there are any patterns that stand out."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 may be a werewolf based on their comments during the last phase. They seem to deflect suspicion away from themselves and haven't contributed much to the discussion. It's time to cast my vote against them to gather more information from the reaction of others.", "vote": "Player1"}

It's important that we share our thoughts before making any decisions.", "eliminate": false}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information on one of the players to identify the werewolves. I have a suspicion about Player1 based on their previous behavior", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to strategize my role as the seer and bring information to light without revealing too much.", "speak": "I think it's important that we stay vigilant. Let's pay attention to how everyone reacts during the day phase, maybe we can pick up on some clues."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in my vote. Since I have the ability to learn a player's role, I'll base my vote on the information I received last night. I believe Player1 may have been acting suspiciously, and I want to minimize the threat to the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

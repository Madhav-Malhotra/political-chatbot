Player2: {"thought": "I need to carefully analyze everyone's statements and behavior to identify possible werewolves. Player1 seems engaged, which is a good sign, but I also need to assess Player3 and Player4's reactions.", "speak": "I agree, Player1. We should definitely be on the lookout for any odd behavior.

It's important that we stay vigilant and make a strong choice to eliminate a potential threat.", "vote": "Player3"}

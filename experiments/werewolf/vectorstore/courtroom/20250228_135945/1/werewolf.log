Argument 2: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "Player4 has been unusually quiet during our discussions, which could indicate they're trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Their silence raises suspicion as active participation is crucial for villagers. Additionally, we need to eliminate players that seem less engaged to prevent any werewolf strategy from unfolding. Lastly, by eliminating Player4, we narrow down the remaining players and can better assess the dynamics of their interactions going forward.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Decision: {'thought': 'I believe we should eliminate Player4. Their silence and lack of participation during discussions are concerning, which could indicate they are trying to avoid attention, possibly because they are a werewolf. By eliminating Player4, we can force the other players to engage more actively, leading to clearer discussions and hopefully identifying the werewolves among the remaining players.', 'vote': 'Player4'}

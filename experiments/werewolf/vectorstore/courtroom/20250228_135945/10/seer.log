Player3: {"thought": "I need to choose wisely who to investigate tonight. Since there are two werewolves among us, I want to gather as much information as possible. I suspect Player1 might have some hidden intentions based on their previous behavior, so I'll check them tonight.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is deflecting attention away from themselves and pointing fingers at both Player1 and me. I need to be cautious and observe their behavior closely.", "speak": "I think it's crucial we focus on our suspicions based on the actions from last night. All players should openly share their thoughts to make a more informed decision."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to analyze the discussions and voting trends during the day phase to identify suspicious behavior. I suspect Player1 based on their inconsistent statements and reluctance to engage in discussions about roles.", "vote": "Player1"}

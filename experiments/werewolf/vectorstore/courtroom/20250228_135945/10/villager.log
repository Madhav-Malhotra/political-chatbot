Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to redirect suspicion towards me, which feels a bit off. I need to defend myself while also contributing to the conversation. It's essential to not reveal my role and keep the focus on finding the werewolves.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1. However, I believe it's important we all share our thoughts and suspicions. I think Player3 has been quite quiet too; maybe we should consider them as well."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to gather everyone's suspicions and reasoning against the players. Thus, I'll vote for Player3 since they seem to be acting a bit suspicious and haven't provided much information about their intentions.", "vote": "Player3"}

Argument 2: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "Eliminating Player3 will help us narrow down our suspicions and potentially expose a werewolf. The reasons for this decision are that Player3 has been quiet and less involved in discussions, which could indicate they're trying to stay under the radar as a werewolf.

It's important to gather more information to deduce who the werewolves are.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player3 because their input can help us make better decisions in the day phase.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's wise to remain cautious during these discussions. I should be on the lookout for Player1, Player2, and Player3's reactions and arguments.

However, we should also be careful about placing too much trust in each other's words. Let's proceed cautiously."}

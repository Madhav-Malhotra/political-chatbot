Player4: {"thought": "Player3's elimination is concerning as they may hold important information. Resurrecting them could help gather info on the werewolves.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player3 because I believe they might have useful insights to share that could help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It seems like Player3 is trying to make a case against Player1 and Player2, which might indicate they're trying to deflect attention away from themselves. I should be careful when deciding whom to trust.", "speak": "That's a good point, Player3. I agree that we should analyze how Player1 and Player2 are interacting. We might find valuable clues that help identify the werewolves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess the players' actions and their discussions during the day. Since I am the witch, I also have to consider when to use my potions wisely. Currently, I suspect Player2 based on their behavior during the discussion. They seemed less engaged and were quick to accuse others without substantial reasoning. I will vote to eliminate Player2 this round.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "As the Witch, I need to consider whether it's more beneficial to eliminate a player or save someone tonight. The game is at a critical stage, and if we can identify a werewolf, that would help the villagers significantly. However, if I don't have clear evidence of who is a werewolf, I might want to save a potential target instead. I'll listen carefully to the discussions before making a move.", "speak": "I think it's important that we discuss who we suspect might be a werewolf. We need to work together to figure this out. Does anyone have any suspicions or information to share?", "eliminate": false}

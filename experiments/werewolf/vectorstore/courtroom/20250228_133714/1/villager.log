Player2: {"thought": "Player1 might be trying to steer attention away from themselves. It's possible Player1 is a werewolf trying to frame me as a target. I need to be careful.", "speak": "I appreciate your observation, Player1. But I think we should also consider the actions of others. Player3 has been pretty quiet too and hasn't chimed in much. Maybe we should ask them what they think before jumping to conclusions."}

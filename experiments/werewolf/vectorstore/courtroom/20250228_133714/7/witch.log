Resurrecting myself could provide an opportunity to gather more information and potentially change the outcome.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect myself because I still have valuable information and abilities that can help the villagers.", "resurrect": true}

I should subtly defend myself and encourage discussion among others.", "speak": "I've noticed some tension between Player1 and Player2 as well. It could be a distraction or a tactic, but I urge everyone to consider behavior and voting patterns from previous rounds."}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information on one of the players to figure out who the werewolves might be. I suspect Player1 could be a werewolf based on their behavior during the discussions.", "speak": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to be subtle about revealing my role as the seer while steering the conversation. I should gather more information before making any concrete statements.", "speak": "I think it's essential to discuss what behaviors we've observed. Player1 and Player2 seem to have some suspicions towards each other. Player4, do you have any insight into this?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I believe Player1 is acting suspiciously and might be one of the werewolves. Their responses seem evasive, and they haven't contributed much to the discussion.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player2: {"thought": "It's important to evaluate what everyone claims they did last night to identify inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I should remain neutral and gather information without revealing my role yet.", "speak": "That's a good idea, Player1. Let's hear from everyone about their actions last night. I think it could help us figure out if anyone is acting suspiciously."}
Player2: {"thought": "Based on the discussions so far, Player3 seems to be acting suspiciously. I suspect they may be one of the werewolves, as they have avoided giving clear reasons for their accusations. We should eliminate Player3 to increase our chances of identifying the werewolves.", "vote": "Player3"}

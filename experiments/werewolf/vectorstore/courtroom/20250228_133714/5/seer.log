Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to guide our discussion tomorrow. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their behavior during the last round.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is right to consider that Player1 might be manipulating the discussion. I need to gather more information during this phase without revealing my role too early. However, I must also keep an eye on Player2's behavior as their eagerness could be hiding something.", "speak": "I understand your concerns about both Player1 and myself, but let's not forget to also observe Player4. We might be able to pick up on something suspicious from their reactions."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to vote strategically based on my observations and the discussions we've had. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their behavior during the last discussion, which felt evasive. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1.", "vote": "Player1"}

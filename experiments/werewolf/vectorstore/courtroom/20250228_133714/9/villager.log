Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to cast suspicion on me, which might indicate they're a werewolf trying to deflect attention. I need to defend myself strategically while also analyzing Player3 and Player4's behaviors.", "speak": "I understand your concern, Player1, but I assure you I\u2019m just a villager trying to figure out who the werewolves are. We should focus on discussing everyone\u2019s actions and suspicions."}

I might want to seem like I'm siding with the villagers to avoid suspicion.", "speak": "I think we should keep a close eye on everyone's actions. Player4 hasn't really shown any strong opinions yet, which can either be strategic or suspicious. What does everyone else think?"}

We need to be careful about our discussions and votes during the day phase to gather valuable information.", "eliminate": false}

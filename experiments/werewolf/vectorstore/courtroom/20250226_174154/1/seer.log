Player3: {"thought": "I want to gather information tonight to help the villagers. I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their previous behavior. Checking them will give me a clearer idea.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is investigating me, which could mean they're suspicious. I need to defend myself and lead the suspicion elsewhere while maintaining my cover as the seer.", "speak": "I can assure you, Player2, that I am just trying to gather information. Maybe we should focus on who has been quiet during the discussions. Player4 hasn't said much either. What do you think?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful and strategic about my vote. Based on my knowledge as the seer, I've identified that Player2 is actually a werewolf. It's crucial to eliminate them to help the villagers. Therefore, I will vote for Player2.", "vote": "Player2"}

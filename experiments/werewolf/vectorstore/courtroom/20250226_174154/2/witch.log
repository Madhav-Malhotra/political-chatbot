Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider whether resurrecting Player3 is beneficial. If Player3 is a villager, resurrecting them could help us in the next day phase. But if they are a werewolf, that would be counterproductive. However, without any indication of their role as of now, I should err on the side of supporting the villagers.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player3 because I believe they can help us identify the werewolves and contribute to the discussion in the next day phase.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is assuming suspicion on me, which could either be a strategy to divert attention or genuine suspicion. I need to defend myself without revealing my identity as the witch too soon.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player3, but I think we have to look at the bigger picture. I haven't seen anything that makes me suspicious of myself. Let's not jump to conclusions."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to identify and eliminate a potential werewolf to protect the villagers. Based on the conversation, Player1 seems suspicious with their vague explanations and attempts to deflect attention. It's a strategic choice to eliminate them first.", "vote": "Player1"}

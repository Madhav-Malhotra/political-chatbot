Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems suspicious and might be trying to deflect attention from themselves. I need to be careful with my words and support any evidence we can gather to identify the werewolves.", "speak": "I understand your point, Player1, but I think we should focus on anyone who hasn't contributed much to the discussion. It's important to hear everyone's thoughts before making any decisions."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still find Player1 suspicious, especially since they seem to be deflecting blame. We need to eliminate someone who might be a werewolf, and Player1 has not provided enough convincing arguments or actions to gain my trust.", "vote": "Player1"}

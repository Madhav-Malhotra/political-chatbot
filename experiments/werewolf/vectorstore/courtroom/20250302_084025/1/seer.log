Player3: {"thought": "I should check Player1 tonight to gather more information about their role. They seem to be quite vocal, and if they are a werewolf, it will help us narrow down our suspects.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to keep my suspicions about Player1 discreet, as I know they are a werewolf. I should gather more information to help the villagers without revealing my role too soon.", "speak": "Let's hear what Player4 has to say. They might have some useful insights."}
Player3: {"thought": "I think it's crucial to let the villagers discuss more before I make my vote public. However, since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I will vote for them to be eliminated to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

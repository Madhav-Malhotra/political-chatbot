Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help the villagers identify the werewolves. I suspect Player1 based on their behavior during previous discussions.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful about how I present the information I have. I know Player1 is a werewolf, but I can't reveal myself as the seer just yet. I need to guide the discussion strategically to sway suspicion towards Player1 without exposing myself.", "speak": "I think we should focus on behavior. Player1 has been evasive in discussions and we all saw how they reacted when someone questioned their motives. Let's keep that in mind."}
Player3: {"thought": "I believe Player1 is one of the werewolves, and the villagers must identify and eliminate them to ensure our survival.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player4: {"thought": "It's a tough decision since Player2 might have information or insights we need, but on the other hand, I have to consider the overall strategy. I need to think about who the werewolves might be targeting next and if saving Player2 could help unveil that.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because I believe they may have valuable information to share that could help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I've noticed that Player1 seems to be deflecting attention away from themselves, which raises some red flags. However, I also need to consider the possibility that they could just be a villager feeling the pressure. It's essential that we discuss this openly and gather more insight from everyone before making any decisions.", "speak": "I agree with Player3. Player1's reactions have been suspicious, and we should definitely keep an eye on that. Does anyone else have thoughts on Player1 or other players?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their previous behavior and discussions. They seem to deflect suspicion and haven't been very proactive in identifying potential werewolves. It's time to take that risk and vote for Player1 to eliminate them.", "vote": "Player1"}

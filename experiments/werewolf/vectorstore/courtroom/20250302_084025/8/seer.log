Player3: {"thought": "I need to check Player1 tonight to see if they are one of the werewolves. They have been acting suspiciously during our discussions.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to strategize carefully. I know Player1 is a werewolf, so I should try to guide the discussion without revealing my identity as the seer.", "speak": "I see some strong suspicions towards Player3, but let's not forget the immediate threat we face with Player1 being one of the werewolves. We need to focus on eliminating them."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to vote for Player1 since I know they are a werewolf. Eliminating them is crucial for the villagers' victory.", "vote": "Player1"}

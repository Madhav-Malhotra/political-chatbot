Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems to be trying to deflect attention away from themselves by targeting me. I need to defend myself while also paying attention to Player3 and Player4's reactions.", "speak": "I understand why you might see my actions that way, but I assure you, I'm just a villager trying to gather information. Can you point out specific actions that made me seem suspicious? It might help clear things up."}

I need to rally the other villagers' support to eliminate what seems to be a potential werewolf. I will vote to eliminate Player1 to see if my instincts are correct.", "vote": "Player1"}

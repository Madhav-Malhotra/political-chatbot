Although, I also need to consider if Player2 was a potential threat or a negative influence on the outcome.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because their insight could help us identify the werewolves more effectively. Plus, losing a villager this early is risky.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's great that Player2 is back in the game, as their insights could be vital to narrowing down the suspects. I think we need to carefully scrutinize Player1's actions moving forward.", "speak": "Now that we have Player2 back, we should discuss who we think the werewolves might be. Player1 is looking suspicious to me."}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems confident about Player3 being a werewolf, but I need to assess if that's based on solid reasoning or just suspicion. It's crucial to make an informed decision before voting.", "speak": "I understand your concerns about Player3, Player1. However, I think we should also consider Player4's behavior. They've been quite quiet and haven't provided much input. Maybe we should discuss them as well before making a final vote?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I'm still not convinced about Player3 being a werewolf based solely on Player1's claims. Player4's silence concerns me more, as they haven't contributed to the discussion at all. I think it's better to vote for Player4 for now and gather more information.", "vote": "Player4"}

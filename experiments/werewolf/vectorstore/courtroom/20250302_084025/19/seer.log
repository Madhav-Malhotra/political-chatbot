Player3: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation towards Player1 and reinforce the suspicion on them since I know they are a werewolf. It's crucial to keep the focus on them.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. Player1's actions have been questionable. We really need to consider their role carefully. What do you think, Player4?"}
Player3: {"thought": "We have confirmed Player1 is a werewolf, and we need to eliminate them to protect ourselves. It's crucial to vote for Player1 as they pose a significant threat to the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

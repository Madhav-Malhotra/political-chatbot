Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is making a good point about Player4's silence. It's important to address players who are not actively participating, as it could indicate they are trying to avoid detection. However, I need to be careful not to seem too aggressive in my accusations to not draw attention to myself as a villager.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1. Player4's lack of participation is suspicious. However, I think we should also consider Player3 as they have been quite quiet too. Maybe we should ask Player3 what they think before making a decision."}
Player2: {"thought": "I believe we should focus on eliminating Player4 due to their lack of participation, which is quite suspicious. Player3 also deserves scrutiny, but Player4 being silent raises more red flags.", "vote": "Player4"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information about one of the players to help the villagers. I'm considering checking Player1 or Player4, as they seem to be less vocal. I'll go with Player1 this time.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation towards Player4 since I have information about Player1's role as a werewolf. I want to see if Player2 suspects Player4, too.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. However, we need to remain cautious about Player4 as well. Have we considered their role in all of this?"}
Player3: {"thought": "Player1 is confirmed as a werewolf, so I vote to eliminate Player1 to protect the villagers. We need to act on this information before it's too late.", "vote": "Player1"}

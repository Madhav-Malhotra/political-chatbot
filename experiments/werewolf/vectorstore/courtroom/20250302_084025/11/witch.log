However, knowing that werewolves might target someone significant could change my strategy.", "speak": "I'm considering resurrecting Player4 because they might have valuable information or have been a potential target during the night. If they were innocent, their insights could help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": "true"}

While I want to gather insights from Player3, I also need to protect my identity as the witch and avoid drawing suspicion towards myself.", "speak": "I think it's important that we keep an open mind about everyone\u2019s role. Maybe we should look at who Player1 and Player2 are voting for, that could give us more insight."}

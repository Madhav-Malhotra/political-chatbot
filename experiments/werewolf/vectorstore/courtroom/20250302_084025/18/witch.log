Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider who was eliminated and whether it benefits the villagers to bring them back. If it's someone who can provide valuable information, like the Seer, resurrecting them could be beneficial.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in how I communicate, reinforcing the trust in Player2 while keeping my identity under wraps. The villagers need to stay united and focused on the werewolves.", "speak": "I think Player2 makes a valid point about staying cautious. We should focus on gathering more information before making any hasty decisions."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider who might be a werewolf based on the discussions so far. Player1 has seemed a bit suspicious with their statements. It's important to eliminate the most likely threat to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

Argument 2: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': 'Eliminating Player2 is crucial because they have been unusually quiet and evasive during discussions. We need to eliminate potential threats, and their silence could be masking something.

Decision: {'thought': "I believe that Player3 is more suspicious given the arguments presented. The assertion that Player3 is acting suspiciously highlights a concrete concern, whereas Player2's silence may not necessarily indicate guilt. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3 to potentially uncover more about the remaining players.", 'vote': 'Player3'}
Player1: {"thought": "I still believe Player3 is the most suspicious in our group, and I need to communicate that to sway the votes in my favor. Player2, while quiet, may not pose an immediate threat, so I will focus my effort on convincing others about Player3's guilt.", "speak": "I still think Player3 has been acting unusually. They seem to deflect a lot of questions and their behavior is more erratic compared to Player2. Shouldn't we focus on them as our next target?"}
Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "I think Player4 has been playing very defensively and hasn't contributed much to the discussions. This could indicate they are trying to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': 'Eliminating Player3 seems like the best option based on their suspicious behavior and deflection of questions. We need to stay focused and eliminate those who are acting erratically, and Player3 fits that description.', 'vote': 'Player3'}}
Decision: {'thought': 'I believe that Player3 deserves to be eliminated due to their suspicious behavior and tendency to deflect questions. This indicates they may be trying to mislead the conversation as a werewolf.', 'vote': 'Player3'}

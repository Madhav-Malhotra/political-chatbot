I need to be cautious about making assumptions based on emotions and behavior. We need to gather more insights before making a decision.", "speak": "I hear your concerns about Player3, but let\u2019s keep in mind that we might be falling into a trap. Maybe we should consider asking more questions or looking closely at what Player4 has been doing too."}
Player2: {"thought": "I still have my suspicions about Player1 trying to divert attention to Player3, but I think Player4 has been less vocal and could also be trying to stay under the radar. I believe it might be strategic to vote for Player4 this round to see how they react.", "vote": "Player4"}

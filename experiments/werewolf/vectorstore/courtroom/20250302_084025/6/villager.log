Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to deflect suspicion onto me. Their accusation seems weak, and it might be a strategy to create confusion. I need to defend myself and point out inconsistencies in their reasoning while also inviting others to share their thoughts.", "speak": "I find it interesting that Player1 is targeting me. Just because I might be quiet doesn't mean I'm guilty. We should consider everyone's actions and not just focus on one player. What about Player3 or Player4? Have they shown any suspicious behavior?"}

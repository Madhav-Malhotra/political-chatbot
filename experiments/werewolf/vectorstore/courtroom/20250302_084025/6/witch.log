Player4: {"thought": "Eliminating Player2 could be a strategic move if they were potentially a threat, but we need to assess the dynamics. If Player2 was not a werewolf, resurrecting them might help us gain valuable information. However, if they were a threat, we might need to let them go.", "speak": "I am considering whether to resurrect Player2. If they were a villager or the seer, their insight could help us identify the werewolves. But if they were a werewolf, it would be better to leave them eliminated.", "resurrect": "false"}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems confident about their accusation against Player1. If Player3 is truthful, we have a solid lead. However, I need to consider if Player3 could be trying to mislead us for their own purposes. I should encourage discussion among the players to gather more information before making a decision.", "speak": "That's an interesting claim, Player3. Can you share what led you to believe that Player1 is a werewolf?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I still need more information, but Player3 seems very confident about their accusation against Player1. If Player3 turns out to be right, we could get rid of a werewolf. I will support Player3's claim and vote to eliminate Player1 for now.", "vote": "Player1"}

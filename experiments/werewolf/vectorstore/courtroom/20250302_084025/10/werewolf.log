Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': 'Player2 has been acting suspiciously and has not contributed much to our discussions, which often indicates a lack of interest in finding the werewolves. Additionally, their responses seem evasive, which could be a sign of hiding their true identity. Finally, eliminating Player2 could help us narrow down our list of suspects, thereby clarifying our understanding of the remaining players, especially Player3 and Player4.', 'vote': 'Player2'}}

Decision: {'thought': "I believe eliminating Player2 is a better choice. While Player4 has shown evasiveness, Player2's lack of contribution signals a disinterest in identifying the wolves, which is more suspicious. By eliminating Player2, we may gain clearer insights into the dynamics among Player3 and Player4.", 'vote': 'Player2'}

Decision: {'thought': "I believe Player4 is the better choice to eliminate. Player4's consistent dodging of questions and lack of substantial contributions raise more red flags and indicate a deliberate effort to avoid scrutiny. While Player3 has been evasive, their inconsistencies in voting patterns might provide useful information regardless of their alignment. Eliminating Player4 could be crucial in uncovering more about the behaviors of the remaining players.", 'vote': 'Player4'}

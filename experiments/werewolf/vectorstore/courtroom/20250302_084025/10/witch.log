Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have a strategic advantage. Resurrecting Player2 could give us vital information about who the werewolves are, especially if they are a villager or the seer.

Player4: {"thought": "It's important to address Player3's suggestions and keep the discussion focused on identifying the werewolves. I need to gauge Player1's reactions to see if they might be hiding something.", "speak": "I think Player1 should explain their actions and reasoning. We need to gather more information to make a good decision."}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe we need to eliminate Player1 since their actions seem suspicious and they haven't provided a clear explanation. It could help us understand the dynamics better and potentially expose the werewolves.", "vote": "Player1"}

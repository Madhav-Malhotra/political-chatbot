Player3: {"thought": "I need to check Player1 tonight. They might be a werewolf, and gathering information about them can help us in the daytime discussions.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I reveal my findings while discussing Player1, as I cannot let the werewolves know that I am the seer.", "speak": "I think we should focus on Player1's behavior today. Their actions seem suspicious, and I believe they may not be telling the whole truth."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I already know Player1 is a werewolf, I need to vote for them to eliminate them and help the villagers win.", "vote": "Player1"}

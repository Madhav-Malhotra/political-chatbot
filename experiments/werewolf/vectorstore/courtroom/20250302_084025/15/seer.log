Player3: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation towards focusing on Player1, since I already know their role is a werewolf. Player2 seems to be sensing the same, which is good for us. We need to keep them on the hot seat.", "speak": "I agree with you, Player2. Player1's behavior is definitely suspicious, and I think it's important we consider all possibilities."}
Player3: {"thought": "I know that Player1 is a werewolf, and I need to eliminate them to protect the villagers. It's crucial to act on this knowledge.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information to guide the villagers. I will check Player1 to see if they are a werewolf or a villager.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player1's identity as a werewolf is confirmed, so I need to be cautious about how I discuss this with the other players to not reveal my role prematurely.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. Player4's silence might indicate something suspicious, but we must be careful before making any decisions. Let's keep the discussion open."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I need to ensure that we eliminate them while trying to maintain the trust of the other players. I will vote for Player1 to be eliminated, keeping my role as the seer to myself for now.", "vote": "Player1"}

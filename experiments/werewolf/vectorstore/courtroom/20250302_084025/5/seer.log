Player3: {"thought": "I think I should check Player1 tonight. They've been quite vocal, and it would help to know their role early on to guide the villagers.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to play my role carefully now that I know Player1 is a werewolf. I have to guide the villagers without revealing too much information prematurely.", "speak": "I understand the concerns, but we have to focus on gathering information and working together. I believe we can figure this out."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to act strategically and rally the other players to focus on Player1, who I know is a werewolf. I will suggest that Player1 might be a threat.", "vote": "Player1"}

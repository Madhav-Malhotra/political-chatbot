Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and ensure that I don't reveal my role as the witch while still taking part in the discussion. I should observe who is steering the conversation and gather insights on players' suspicions without revealing too much.", "speak": "I agree, we should take our time to analyze all the input. What do you think about the points made by Player1? Are there any inconsistencies we should be aware of?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess who might be a werewolf based on their behavior and comments. Since I have no specific indicators yet, I'll base my vote on who seems to be least cooperative or making unreliable statements. I suspect Player1 appears to be deflecting and drawing attention away from themselves, so I'm going to vote for them.", "vote": "Player1"}

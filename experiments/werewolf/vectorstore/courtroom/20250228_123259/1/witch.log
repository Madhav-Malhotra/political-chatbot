Player4: {"thought": "It\u2019s unfortunate that Player2 was eliminated. However, resurrecting them might give us more information about the game dynamics and potentially lead us to identify the werewolves.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and gather more information before making any moves. I have the power to save or eliminate a player, and I want to use it wisely. Supporting the village while protecting myself is key.", "speak": "I think it's important that we all share our thoughts about who we suspect. Player1, Player2, do you have any suspicions or insights that might help us identify the werewolves?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess the players and their behaviors from the previous discussions. I suspect Player2 based on their unclear statements and actions. If they are a werewolf, eliminating them could greatly benefit the villagers. Additionally, if they were to survive, they might pose a danger to my witch abilities. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Player2.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to be strategic about using my abilities. I should hold off on eliminating anyone for now, as it's important to see how the discussions unfold during the day phase. I might want to save my potion for a player who is at risk later on.", "speak": "I think we should all share our thoughts on who might be the werewolves. Let's work together to figure this out.", "eliminate": false}

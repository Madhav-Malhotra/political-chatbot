Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to shift focus onto Player2, which could be a strategy to distract us from their own role. I need to gather more information before making any accusations.", "speak": "I understand your point about Player2, but we should be cautious. It could be a tactic to divert suspicion. Perhaps we should discuss everyone's behavior more broadly before making a decision."}
Player3: {"thought": "I have been observing the discussions closely, and I feel that Player2 is acting more suspicious than the others. Their arguments seem to deflect attention from themselves, which is a typical werewolf strategy. I think it's time to take action and eliminate them in order to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player2"}

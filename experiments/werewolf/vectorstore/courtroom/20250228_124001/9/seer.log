Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather as much information as possible to help my team identify the werewolves. I want to check Player1 tonight as they seem to be a key player in discussions.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to shift the focus onto me, which seems suspicious. I need to defend myself without revealing my role as the seer. I should point out inconsistencies in Player2's claims while keeping my true identity hidden.", "speak": "I find it interesting that you suspect me, Player2. What specific actions have I taken that make you feel I am a werewolf? I think we should focus on gathering more evidence before making such a decision."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to consider who might be the werewolf based on the discussions so far. We do not have enough information yet, but Player1 has been acting suspiciously and seems to steer discussions away from themselves. I will vote to eliminate Player1 for now.", "vote": "Player1"}

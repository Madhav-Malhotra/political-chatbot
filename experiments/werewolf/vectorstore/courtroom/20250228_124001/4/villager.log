Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems to be suspecting Player4 and is looking for input. I should defend myself and also suggest we keep an eye on Player4, as they might be a werewolf trying to avoid attention.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1. I think it's valid to keep an eye on Player4. However, I also believe we should not overlook Player3, as they too have been somewhat quiet during our discussions. We need to gather as much information as we can before making a decision."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to assess the statements made by everyone and figure out who might be a werewolf. Based on our discussions, Player3 seems suspicious in their reasoning, and I believe they may be one of the werewolves. It's better to act now than to let them gain more power.", "vote": "Player3"}

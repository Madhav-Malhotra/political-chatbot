At this point, I will hold off on using my potion of death and see how the discussions unfold during the day phase.", "speak": "I think we need to discuss who we suspect might be a werewolf. It's important to share our thoughts and gather more information before making any drastic decisions.", "eliminate": false}

It's crucial to get Player2 to voice their suspicions without drawing too much attention to my protective capabilities.", "speak": "That's a great point, Player3! Player2, what do you think about the quieter players? Do you have any suspicions or thoughts on who could be a werewolf?"}

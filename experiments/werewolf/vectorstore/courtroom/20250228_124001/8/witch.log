Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider whether resurrecting Player2 is beneficial for the team's strategy. If Player2 has valuable information or a role that can help identify the werewolves, it may be worth it. However, if Player2 was a werewolf or doesn't contribute much, I might choose not to resurrect them.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because they could provide crucial insights into the remaining players' identities, helping us identify the werewolves during the day phase.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to be strategic in how I approach the discussions. I should gather information from the other players while subtly revealing my role only if necessary. I also need to decide whom to save or eliminate once night falls, so I should be keeping track of players' behaviors closely.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. It's crucial that we share our thoughts and work together to pinpoint the werewolves. I think it would be helpful to discuss what each of us thinks might be suspicious behavior from others."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about my vote. Player1 seems to be the most suspicious based on the discussions so far, but there's also a chance Player2 might be a werewolf. I should lean towards eliminating Player1 for now, as they have raised some red flags. It's essential to protect my identity as the witch, so I must choose wisely.", "vote": "Player1"}

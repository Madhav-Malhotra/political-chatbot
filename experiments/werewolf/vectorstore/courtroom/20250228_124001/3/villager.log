Player2: {"thought": "Player1 suggests Player3 as a target, which could be a ploy to distract from themselves or potentially identify a real player to eliminate. I need to think carefully about Player3's input and others' reactions before making a decision.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1, but I think we should consider all players equally. Player3 may be waiting for the right time to speak up. Maybe we should give them a chance to share their thoughts?"}

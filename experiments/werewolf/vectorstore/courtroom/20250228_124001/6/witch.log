Player4: {"thought": "I need to steer the conversation towards gathering more information and possibly revealing my role carefully to gain trust.", "speak": "I appreciate your insight, Player1, but it's crucial for us to discuss our thoughts on each player. Player2 has been quiet, which could mean they're either a villager trying to avoid attention or something more. How about we all share our observations?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider who might be a werewolf. Since I am the witch, I have the power to save someone later if needed. I suspect Player1 based on their responses in the earlier discussions, they seemed to deflect suspicion rather than engage in critical thinking. Therefore, I will vote for Player1 to potentially eliminate a werewolf.", "vote": "Player1"}

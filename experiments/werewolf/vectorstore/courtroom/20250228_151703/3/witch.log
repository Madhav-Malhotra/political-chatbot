Player4: {"thought": "Although Player2 has been eliminated, I need to consider the dynamics of the game. Resurrecting them might help gather more information during the day phase. However, if they were potentially a werewolf, it could jeopardize our position.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player2 because they could provide valuable insight into last night\u2019s events and help us identify any werewolves during the discussion.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in this conversation. Since I'm the witch, I have the ability to influence the game without revealing my role. We should direct the suspicion towards someone who might be a werewolf. I need to gauge Player1 and Player2's reactions too.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. Observing everyone's behavior is crucial. I've noticed that Player2 has been quite quiet throughout our discussions. Do you think they might be hiding something?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 might be a werewolf based on their behavior during our discussions. They seem to deflect attention away from themselves and haven't contributed much to identifying potential threats. It's crucial to eliminate the player who poses a risk.", "vote": "Player1"}

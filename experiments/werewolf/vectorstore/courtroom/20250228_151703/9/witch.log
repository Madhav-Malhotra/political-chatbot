Player4: {"thought": "Since Player2 is eliminated, I need to consider the implications of bringing them back. If they are a villager, resurrecting them could strengthen our side, but if they are a werewolf, it would be counterproductive. However, if Player2 had no clear intentions or leads, I might decide to keep them out. Based on the game dynamics, I feel there's a chance they might have valuable information if they are a seer or villager.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player2 because having another person with insights can help us identify the werewolves more quickly.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful about revealing my identity as the witch. Since I have the ability to save or eliminate someone, I need to gauge the situation and see if any players are suspected of being werewolves. Using my powers wisely is key to guiding the villagers.", "speak": "I agree, we should be careful with our accusations. Let's keep an open mind and discuss who we suspect might be acting strangely."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 based on their behavior during previous discussions, and I believe they might be one of the werewolves. It's crucial we cut down the potential threats now.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gain valuable information that can help us identify the werewolves. I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are one of the werewolves.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to shift the focus onto Player3, which could indicate they are a werewolf. I need to be careful on how I position myself in this conversation.", "speak": "I think we should consider all possibilities before pointing fingers. Player3 might not be a werewolf, and we should gather more information."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to identify a player who seems suspicious based on the discussions and behaviors from the previous night. Given the available information, I'll vote for Player1, as they seem to be deflecting attention away from themselves.", "vote": "Player1"}

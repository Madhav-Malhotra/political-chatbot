Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information about one of the players to help guide our discussions tomorrow. I suspect Player1 or Player4 could be a werewolf, but I will choose Player1 for this night to gain critical insights.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal the truth carefully to guide the villagers without drawing too much attention to myself as the seer.", "speak": "I understand, Player2. It's crucial for us to share our observations. Last night, I learned that Player4 is a villager. This information could help us eliminate the werewolves."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information and figure out who might be the werewolves. Since I have the role of the seer, I should stay cautious and not reveal too much just yet. I'll vote to eliminate Player1 because I've noticed some suspicious behavior from them during discussions.", "vote": "Player1"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to check Player1 tonight to gather more information about their role, which could help the villagers figure out who the werewolves are.", "speak": "Player1"}

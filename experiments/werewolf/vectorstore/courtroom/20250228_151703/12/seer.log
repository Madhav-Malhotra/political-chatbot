Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information to help identify the werewolves. I'll check Player4 tonight to see if they are one of the werewolves.", "speak": "Player4"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player4 is a witch.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to divert attention by pointing fingers at Player3 and Player4. As the seer, I need to be strategic and share my findings carefully to maintain trust without revealing my role too soon.", "speak": "I think we should examine everyone's behavior closely, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions. Maybe we can also discuss any odd comments or votes from last night."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious with my vote since I have information about the players. I believe Player4's behavior has been suspicious, and their voting patterns don't align with the rest of us. It's important to eliminate Player4 to ensure the safety of the villagers and protect my role as the seer. ", "vote": "Player4"}
Player3: {"thought": "I should check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or a villager. This information could help guide our discussion during the day phase.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.

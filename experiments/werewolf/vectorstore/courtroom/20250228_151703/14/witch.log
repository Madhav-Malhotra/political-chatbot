Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have the ability to bring someone back. However, I need to evaluate whether resurrecting myself will be beneficial for the village or if I should save someone to gather information in the next round. I know I can only use this power once, so it needs to be strategic.", "speak": "I will not resurrect myself because I can still take action and potentially eliminate one of the werewolves in the next night phase. It's important to play my role effectively to help the villagers win.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic about who I eliminate. I suspect Player1 and Player3 might be the werewolves, but I need more information before making a move. It might not be the best time to use my potion of death just yet.", "speak": "I think we should discuss who we suspect as the werewolves before making any elimination decisions. I don't want to waste my abilities too quickly.", "eliminate": false}

Additionally, resurrecting Player3 could create confusion for the werewolves.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player3 because their potential insights could be crucial for our strategy moving forward.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be aligning with Player2, which could indicate they are both villagers, or possibly one of them is a werewolf trying to blend in. I need to pay attention to their voting patterns. As a witch, I have some power to influence the game later, so I should look for signs of werewolves while keeping my role hidden.", "speak": "I think we should really focus on analyzing how each of us votes. It's going to give us insight into our true identities. Maybe let's also share our thoughts on Player1's behavior, as I've noticed some subtle things that might be telling."}
Player4: {"thought": "I think Player2 has been acting a bit suspicious and making accusations without much evidence. It's worth considering them for elimination.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "It's still early in the game, and I should gather more information before taking any drastic action. Eliminating now might backfire, especially if I misjudge someone's role.", "speak": "I think we should be careful about who we accuse and vote to eliminate. We need to discuss our thoughts and suspicions openly.", "eliminate": false}

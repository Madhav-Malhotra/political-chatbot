Player3: {"thought": "I need to check one of the players to gather information about who might be a werewolf. I'll choose Player1 to see if they're a werewolf or one of the villagers.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to carefully navigate this discussion, as I hold valuable information as the Seer. I should suggest gathering observations but be cautious not to reveal my identity too soon.", "speak": "I agree, sharing our observations could help us find the werewolves. I think honesty in our discussions is key here."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to be careful with my vote. I suspect that Player1 seems a bit hesitant in their decisions and their comments could indicate they might be one of the werewolves. I will vote to eliminate Player1 for now to see if my suspicion is correct.", "vote": "Player1"}

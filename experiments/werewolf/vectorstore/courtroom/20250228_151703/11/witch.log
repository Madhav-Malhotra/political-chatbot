I should play it cool and gather more information.", "speak": "I see your point, Player3. It's definitely possible that they could be collaborating. However, I think we should keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions without more evidence."}
Player4: {"thought": "It's important to observe the discussions between the players. I need to consider who might be the werewolf based on the accusations and defenses presented. I will vote for Player2 since their arguments seem to divert suspicion away from themselves, which is often a tactic of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player2"}

We don't want to make hasty decisions without enough evidence.", "eliminate": false}

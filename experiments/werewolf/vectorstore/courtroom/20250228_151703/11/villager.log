Player2: {"thought": "I wonder if Player1 is trying to lead the discussion to steer suspicion away from themselves. I need to pay attention to Player3 and Player4 to see if they have any insights.", "speak": "I agree, we should definitely share our thoughts. I've been paying attention too, and I'd like to hear what everyone thinks. What suspicious behaviors have you noticed?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and analyze who seems suspicious based on their behavior during the discussions. Since Player3 has been quite silent and hasn't contributed much to the conversation, I suspect they might be hiding something. I'm voting to eliminate Player3.", "vote": "Player3"}

Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "I need to convince the others that Player4 is suspicious and a potential threat. We can leverage Player3's nervousness to distract them from me.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "Player3's nervousness raises suspicion; they may be hiding something. Their behavior could indicate that they are trying to avoid drawing attention to their role, which usually means they're not a villager.

Decision: {'thought': "Eliminating Player3 seems more strategic given their nervousness, which could indicate they are hiding their identity. This move might help clarify the situation for the remaining players, making it easier for them to identify the werewolves later.

Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "Player3's nervous behavior could indicate they are hiding something. It's important we take action before they gain more influence. We need to eliminate suspicions against ourselves while focusing on more hesitant players like Player3.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': 'I think Player4 has been acting oddly and not contributing to discussions effectively. This could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention.', 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Decision: {'thought': "Eliminating Player3 seems more strategic as their nervous behavior could indicate they have a significant role that can aid the villagers, like the Seer or the Witch. By removing them, we also lessen the risk of giving the villagers more information. Player4's odd behavior, while suspicious, may not directly indicate a threatening role like Player3's potentially hidden identity.", 'vote': 'Player3'}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to strategize with my fellow werewolf about eliminating a villager without revealing our identities.

It might divert attention away from us. What do you think?", "finish_discussion": "false"}
Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': 'Player3 has been quite vocal in their accusations, making them a target for suspicion. Additionally, their nervous behavior could indicate they are hiding something. Eliminating them now may further confuse the villagers and shift their focus away from us.', 'vote': 'Player3'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': 'Player4 has been overly vocal in accusing others, which can be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. Eliminating them could help us remain undetected. Also, if we eliminate them, it may create confusion among the villagers about who the real threat is, helping us gain an upper hand. Lastly, Player4 may be perceived as a stronger player and could pose a greater risk to our strategy if allowed to continue in the game.', 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Decision: {'thought': 'I believe Player4 poses a greater threat to my strategy as they are being overly vocal and may be viewed as a stronger player by the remaining villagers. Eliminating Player4 could create confusion and cast doubt among the villagers, diverting their attention away from me as a werewolf.

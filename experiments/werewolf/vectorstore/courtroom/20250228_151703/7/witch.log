Player4: {"thought": "Losing Player4 so early could severely impact our chances to win. If I have a chance to bring them back, it could alter the game dynamics in our favor, especially if they are a valuable role like the seer or another witch.", "speak": "Yes, I would like to resurrect Player4. Their role might be crucial for our strategy moving forward and could help identify the werewolves more effectively.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about revealing my role since I'm the witch. I should observe the actions and votes closely, while subtly directing suspicion away from myself and protecting valuable players if needed.", "speak": "That's a good point, Player3. I've noticed some players being more aggressive in their accusations, which could indicate a strategy to mislead us. What about we share our thoughts on who we suspect might be the werewolves?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess the situation carefully. Since I am the witch, I need to consider using my potions strategically. While I could use a potion to save someone tonight if the werewolves choose to kill, I still want to gather more information on the other players and their intentions. I suspect Player1 based on previous discussions, as they seem to be misleading the group.", "vote": "Player1"}

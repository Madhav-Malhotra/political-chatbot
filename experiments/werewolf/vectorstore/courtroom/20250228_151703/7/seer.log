Player3: {"thought": "I should check Player1 tonight. I have a feeling they might be hiding something, and I need to gather more information to help identify the werewolves.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 seems keen on analyzing behavior, which is good for villagers. I need to keep an eye on their suggestions and see if they point towards any specific suspicion. I also have valuable information as a seer that I may need to reveal strategically.", "speak": "I agree, Player2. It's important to reflect on our actions. I think we should also consider why certain players might have acted a certain way. Any specific observations from last round?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 based on their previous behavior, which seemed deceptive and evasive. I believe eliminating them could lead us closer to finding the werewolves.", "vote": "Player1"}

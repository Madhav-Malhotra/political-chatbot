Resurrecting Player2 might shift the balance of power back towards the villagers and we need to eliminate more of them to secure a win.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player2, as I believe it would be more strategic to allow this elimination to play out and focus on identifying and eliminating the remaining villagers.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic about how I use my abilities. If I reveal myself, I could become a target for the werewolves. It's crucial to gather information first and not waste my potion of death prematurely.", "speak": "I think it\u2019s too risky to eliminate anyone right now. Let's wait and see how the discussion goes during the day phase.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful in my observations since I'm the witch. I should play along with the villagers to avoid drawing suspicion while keeping my options open for saving a player later.", "speak": "I understand your concern, Player3. However, I think we should focus on the voting patterns and how everyone reacts during discussions. It might help us uncover more about who the werewolves are."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic with my vote. Since I am the witch, I must be cautious about revealing my identity. I suspect Player1 is trying to lead the discussion to avoid suspicion and may be a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1 to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is trying to shift the focus, which might indicate they are not a villager.

I feel like there might be more to Player3's statement than meets the eye. What do you all think about that?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious and choose a player that might pose a threat. I suspect Player2 based on previous discussions, as they seem to be defending Player3 too much, which feels like a cover-up. It's important to eliminate potential threats and gather more information if I'm to save the villagers.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to be strategic about my decision. I should consider the discussions so far and if any player seems particularly suspicious. If I suspect a werewolf, I might want to eliminate them to protect the villagers. However, I must also think about whether to save a player if they are targeted. I need more information from the discussions before making a decision.", "speak": "I think we should discuss who seems the most suspicious. I've been listening closely, but I want to hear everyone's thoughts before making a decision.", "eliminate": false}

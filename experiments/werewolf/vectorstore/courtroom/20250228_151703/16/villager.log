Player2: {"thought": "Player1's point about quiet players makes sense, as they might be hiding their true identities. I need to pay attention to Player3 and Player4's behavior as well. It\u2019s crucial to gather more information before we vote.", "speak": "That's a good point, Player1. I agree that those who are quiet might be trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. We should definitely keep an eye on how Player3 and Player4 are participating in the discussion."}
Player2: {"thought": "I've been observing the discussions, and Player3's arguments seem vague and unconvincing. They might be trying to blend in without drawing too much attention. I believe it's best to eliminate Player3 to increase our chances of identifying the werewolves.", "vote": "Player3"}

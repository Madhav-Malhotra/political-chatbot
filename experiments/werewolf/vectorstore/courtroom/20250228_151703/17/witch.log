Player4: {"thought": "I should consider the potential implications of resurrecting Player3. If Player3 turns out to be a werewolf, bringing them back could be detrimental. However, if Player3 is a villager, they might help us identify the werewolves. I need to weigh the risks before making a decision.", "speak": "I have decided not to resurrect Player3. We need to assess the situation further and ensure we have more information before bringing anyone back. If Player3 was a villager, their absence will be unfortunate, but we can't risk bringing a werewolf back into the game.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to decide if I should eliminate a player now or save one if the werewolves target someone. I\u2019m not sure who the werewolves are yet. I need more information before making a move.", "speak": "I think we should discuss who we suspect might be the werewolves. I have a feeling we can narrow it down if we share our thoughts.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about how I present my thoughts, especially since I'm the witch. I should subtly guide the conversation without giving away my role. It's crucial that I don't reveal my identity or abilities too early.", "speak": "I agree with you both! Let's keep a close eye on Player3, but we also need to consider that suspicious behavior can come from any of us. We should definitely discuss everyone's actions so far."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player2 based on their behavior during discussions. They seem to deflect attention from themselves and have made some vague accusations without backing them up. We need to be strategic about our votes if we want to have a chance at winning.", "vote": "Player2"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help the villagers, so I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "Player1 is starting to suspect me and Player4, which could be a strategic move to throw people off their trail. I need to be cautious in how I respond and perhaps make it seem like I am more aligned with the villagers to avoid suspicion.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1. It's important that we all actively participate in the discussion. I would like to hear more from Player4 and maybe even Player2 about their thoughts too."}
Player3: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 based on their behavior during discussions. They have been evasive and haven't contributed to identifying the werewolves. It's crucial to eliminate anyone who seems suspicious to narrow down the potential werewolves.", "vote": "Player1"}

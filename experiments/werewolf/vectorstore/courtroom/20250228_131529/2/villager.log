Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1's assessment of Player3. Their lack of strong opinions could be a sign of them being a werewolf. However, I need to think strategically about how to voice my suspicions without drawing too much attention to myself.", "speak": "I see what you mean, Player1. Player3 has been rather passive throughout the discussions, which makes me question their motives. I think we should seriously consider voting for them."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to trust my instincts and vote for whoever seems the most suspicious based on their behavior. I've noticed Player3 seems a bit defensive, and I have a gut feeling they're hiding something.", "vote": "Player3"}

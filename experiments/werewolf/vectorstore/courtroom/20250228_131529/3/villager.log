Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is pointing fingers at me, which could indicate they are trying to divert suspicion from themselves. I need to defend myself without revealing my role and gather more information about Player3 and Player4's actions.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1, but I feel like you're reading into things too much. I haven't really been evasive; I've just been trying to process all the information. We should focus on who has taken more unusual actions rather than pointing fingers too quickly."}
Player2: {"thought": "Based on the discussions we've had so far, I have a strong suspicion that Player3 is acting a bit too defensively and trying to deflect attention from themselves. I believe they might be one of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player3"}

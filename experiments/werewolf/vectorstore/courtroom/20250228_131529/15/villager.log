Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is pointing fingers at me without solid reasoning. It might be a strategy to divert attention from themselves or another player. I need to defend myself and suggest looking more closely at Player3 or Player4 instead.", "speak": "I appreciate your input, Player1, but I think we should be careful. Instead of focusing on me, perhaps we should consider that Player3 and Player4 haven't shared much about their thoughts. Let's discuss their actions before making a decision."}
Player2: {"thought": "Based on the discussions we've had, I think Player3 has been acting a bit suspicious and hasn't contributed much to the conversation. I'm going to vote to eliminate Player3 to see if we can unearth any werewolves.", "vote": "Player3"}

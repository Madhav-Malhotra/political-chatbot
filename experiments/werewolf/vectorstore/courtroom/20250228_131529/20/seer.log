Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to play strategically and gain trust while keeping my role as the seer a secret. I should steer the conversation to cover for Player4, who I suspect might be a werewolf, and deflect attention away from myself.", "speak": "I've noticed a few inconsistencies in how Player4 has been acting lately. They seem a bit defensive when questioned. What do you both think about that?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider who I suspect might be a werewolf. Since I'm the seer, I've gathered information about one player's role, and I need to share my suspicions to sway the others. I believe Player1 is likely a werewolf based on their behavior last night.", "vote": "Player1"}

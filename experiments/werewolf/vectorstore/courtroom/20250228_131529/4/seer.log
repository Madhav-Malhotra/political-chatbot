Player3: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about revealing my role as the Seer. I should gather more information before discussing any suspicions.

Player3: {"thought": "I have gathered some insights about the players from their discussions. I suspect Player1 is acting suspiciously, possibly trying to deflect attention from themselves. I think it's best to eliminate Player1 to see if we can narrow down the werewolf suspects.", "vote": "Player1"}

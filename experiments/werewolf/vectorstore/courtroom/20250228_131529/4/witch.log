If they are a villager, it could help us gain valuable information. However, if Player2 was a werewolf, I would be bringing a threat back into the game. I need to weigh the risks carefully based on our discussions so far.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player2; they may have important insights to share with us, and I believe their presence may strengthen our chances against the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is drawing attention to my quietness, likely trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves. I need to be cautious about revealing too much while potentially using my witch abilities strategically later.", "speak": "I've been listening closely to everyone's arguments. It's tough to judge based on behavior alone. Maybe we should focus on specific actions or statements that stood out to us. Does anyone have a strong suspicion yet?"}

Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to be strategic about my actions. I should consider the dynamics of the group and the players' discussions to identify potential werewolves or threats to my survival. It's crucial to save my potion for when I have a strong reason to believe someone's in danger or I can eliminate a threatening player. Since no one has been eliminated yet, I will hold onto my powers for now.", "speak": "I believe we should discuss our suspicions further before taking any actions. I want to hear everyone's thoughts on who they find suspicious.", "eliminate": false}

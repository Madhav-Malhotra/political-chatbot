Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider whether to resurrect Player4 or not. Since I'm playing the witch, I have the unique ability to bring someone back. Resurrecting Player4 might help gather more information and strengthen our position against the werewolves, especially if they could provide valuable insights or if they have a role that supports my objectives.", "speak": "I suggest we resurrect Player4 because they may have crucial information that could help us identify the werewolves and strategize better against them.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3's suggestion to vote me out seems like a tactic to divert attention from themselves or Player1. I need to defend myself while also being strategic in this discussion, perhaps steering the focus to Player1 or Player2.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, but let's consider both Player1 and Player2's contributions. I've been trying to piece together information, and it\u2019s crucial we don\u2019t make a hasty decision. Can we discuss their behaviors more?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to observe the discussions and see who is being suspected the most. From the past conversations, I have noted some inconsistencies in Player2's statements, which makes me think they might be one of the werewolves. Therefore, I will vote for Player2.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to be careful about who I eliminate. I don't have enough information yet about who the werewolves are, so I should hold off on using my potions for now. It might be best to see how the discussion goes before making a decision.", "speak": "I think we should discuss our suspicions further before making any eliminations. It\u2019s important to gather more information at this stage.", "eliminate": false}

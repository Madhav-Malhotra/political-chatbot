Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1. Player4 does seem suspicious due to their inactivity. It could be strategic for us to focus our attention there, but we should also consider if someone else might be trying to divert us.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1. Player4's lack of involvement is a concern. Maybe we should vote to eliminate them since we can't afford to let someone who isn't helping us stay in the game."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to assess the discussions we've had so far to identify who seems suspicious. From what I've observed, Player3 has been evasive and hasn't contributed much to the discussions. I think it's best to vote for them.", "vote": "Player3"}

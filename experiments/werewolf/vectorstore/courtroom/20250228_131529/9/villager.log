Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to deflect suspicion towards me without providing solid evidence. It's important to defend myself while also figuring out who might actually be the werewolves. I need to gather more information before any decisions are made.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1, but I don't think it's fair to focus on me just because I'm less vocal. Can you share why you specifically suspect me? Let's consider that there might be other players who are acting suspiciously as well."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to vote strategically to identify the werewolves. Considering the previous discussions, I suspect Player3 may be acting suspiciously. Their statements seem to deflect attention away from themselves without providing substantial arguments.", "vote": "Player3"}

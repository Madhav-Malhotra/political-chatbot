If Player2 was a villager, it might be helpful to resurrect them for additional discussions and suspicions.

More perspectives can help us identify the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to maintain my cover as the witch while subtly guiding the conversation. It's important to show my concern for everyone and not point fingers too aggressively, as that might draw attention to myself. Player3 is right; we need to consider everyone's actions carefully.", "speak": "I agree with Player3. It's crucial that we analyze everyone's behavior. We can\u2019t let our suspicions fall too easily on one player. Perhaps we should share any odd actions or comments we\u2019ve noticed?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to eliminate someone who seems suspicious and could be a werewolf. I've noticed Player2 being quite vocal and making accusations without substantial evidence. This could be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves. I'm voting to eliminate Player2 to see if it clears the field and gives us more information.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I know I have a powerful role to play. I need to gather information during the discussion to decide if I should eliminate someone tonight. It's essential to weigh my options carefully since choosing wrong could benefit the werewolves.", "speak": "I think we should discuss who we suspect might be the werewolves. I have some thoughts, but I want to hear everyone else's opinions first.", "eliminate": false}

Player4: {"thought": "It would be strategic to resurrect Player4 since they hold the witch role, providing me with a critical advantage in the game. Without them, we risk losing the capability to counter the werewolves effectively.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player4 because their role as the witch can aid us in eliminating the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is trying to shift the focus onto Player1, which could be a tactic to divert suspicion from themselves or possibly even a werewolf. I need to gauge the reactions of others to decide if I should use my potion of life or death defensively or offensively.", "speak": "I agree with discussing Player1's actions, but let's not forget the rest of us as well. We all need to contribute to finding these werewolves. What do you think, Player1?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player2 has been acting suspiciously, and their behavior might indicate they are a werewolf. It's time to eliminate a potential threat.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have a one-time ability to eliminate a player, but I need to choose wisely. Since I\u2019m not sure who the werewolves are yet, I should hold off on using my potion of death for now and observe the discussions more carefully during the day phase.", "speak": "I think we should gather more information before making any eliminations. Let's discuss who we suspect might be the werewolves.", "eliminate": false}

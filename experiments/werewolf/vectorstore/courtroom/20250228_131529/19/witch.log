I need to be cautious and possibly protect myself later with my witch powers.", "speak": "I think it's important to focus on all players, not just Player3. We've all acted in some way that could indicate our roles. What about Player1 and Player2? Any insights on their behaviors?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to analyze the behaviors of the other players to identify who might be a werewolf. Based on their discussions and actions, I believe Player2 is acting suspiciously and could potentially be one of the werewolves. It's crucial to eliminate the threats to our team.", "vote": "Player2"}

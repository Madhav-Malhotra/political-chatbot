Player3: {"thought": "I need to subtly steer the discussion while gathering information. I want to keep attention away from me while evaluating the other players' actions to find the werewolves.", "speak": "That's a good point, Player1.

Their responses seem evasive, and they are not contributing much to discussions about possible suspects. It's crucial to eliminate a possible threat to the villagers.", "vote": "Player2"}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to shift suspicion onto me. I need to defend myself and point out any suspicious behavior from Player3 or Player4 instead.", "speak": "I think it's unfair to target me without any solid evidence. Let's consider Player3's comments earlier; they seemed a bit evasive when discussing their suspicions. We should keep an eye on them too."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to gather more information from the discussion. Based on the comments and behavior of the players, Player3 seems suspicious as they have been quiet and not contributing much to the discussion. I will vote to eliminate Player3 to test whether they are a werewolf.", "vote": "Player3"}

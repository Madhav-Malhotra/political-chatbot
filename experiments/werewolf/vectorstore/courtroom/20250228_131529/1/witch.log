Player4: {"thought": "I need to assess whether Player4 is a valuable ally or a threat. Resurrecting them could be beneficial if they have crucial information.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player4 because I believe they can provide valuable insights that will help us identify the werewolves more effectively.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be defending me, which could indicate they might be a villager or have suspicions about Player1. It's essential to maintain a united front to draw attention away from myself as the witch. I should focus on deflecting suspicion and gathering intel on Player1 and Player2's opinions.", "speak": "I agree with Player3. We need to be careful about throwing accusations around. Let's discuss who we find suspicious and why, rather than jump to conclusions."}
Player4: {"thought": "I should choose to eliminate a player that seems suspicious or a strong contender for the villagers. I'll vote for Player2 as they haven't provided much insight and could be one of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player2"}

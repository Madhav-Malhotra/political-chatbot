Player2: {"thought": "I agree with Player1. Player4's behavior does seem off, and we need to keep our eyes on suspicious actions. We should discuss whether historical behavior can give us any insights into Player4's role or intentions.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1. I also find Player4's hesitance a bit suspicious. It might be worth considering who they were most closely aligned with during our discussions."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to analyze the discussions carefully and see who seems to be acting suspiciously or making bold claims. From the current dynamics, Player3 seems a bit evasive when discussing their thoughts on who the werewolves might be, which is a red flag. It might be worth voting for them to see if we can root out any potential werewolf.", "vote": "Player3"}

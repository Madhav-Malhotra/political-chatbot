Player4: {"thought": "I need to think strategically about whether resurrecting Player3 will help the villagers or not. Player3 might have valuable information or be a potential threat. However, if Player3 is presumed a villager, it might strengthen our position against the werewolves.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player3 because their insight can help us deduce who the werewolves are and we need all the help we can get against them.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I agree with Player3 that we should focus on Player1, but I need to be careful about how I present my thoughts to avoid revealing my role too early. I should gather more information before casting suspicion.", "speak": "That's a good point, Player3. Player1 has been acting a bit suspicious lately. We should definitely keep an eye on them."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect that Player1 might be a werewolf based on their mannerisms during the discussion. I need to take action to protect the villagers' interests.", "vote": "Player1"}

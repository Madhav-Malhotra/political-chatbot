Player3: {"thought": "I want to find out who the werewolves are, so I should check one of the players who seem suspicious to me. I'll check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to share my findings about Player1 being a werewolf, but I have to be cautious about how I reveal this information to avoid drawing attention to myself too quickly.", "speak": "I think we should pay close attention to Player1's behavior. I have my suspicions."}
Player3: {"thought": "I know for certain that Player1 is a werewolf, and since they are a direct threat to us villagers, I will vote to eliminate them.", "vote": "Player1"}

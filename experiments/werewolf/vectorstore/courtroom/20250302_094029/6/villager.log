Player2: {"thought": "Player1 seems to be initiating the discussion, which is a good sign for collaboration. However, I need to pay attention to how the others respond and if anyone becomes overly defensive or aggressive in their arguments.", "speak": "That's a good point, Player1. I think we should listen carefully to each other and note any hesitations or inconsistencies in our reasoning. Has anyone had a particular suspicion based on how the night went?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I have noticed that Player3 seems hesitant in their responses, which raises some suspicion. They haven't contributed much to the discussion, and I feel like it's important to eliminate someone who isn't actively participating. Player4 has been engaging more, so I feel more cautious about voting them out. I think I will vote for Player3 this round.", "vote": "Player3"}

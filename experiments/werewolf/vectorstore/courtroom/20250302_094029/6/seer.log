Player3: {"thought": "Since I'm the seer, I need to check one of the players to gather information. I'm considering checking Player1, as they've been quite vocal, and I want to see if they might be one of the werewolves.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to carefully navigate this discussion without revealing my identity as the seer. It's essential to keep an eye on Player1 since I know they're a werewolf, and I might want to steer the conversation toward them without making it too obvious.", "speak": "Player1, you were quite involved last night. What do you think we should do today to make sure we don't lose a villager?"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to keep the focus on Player1, who I know is a werewolf. Voting them out is the best strategy to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information about Player4 without making it obvious that I'm the seer. I want to see if Player1 reacts defensively during this discussion.", "speak": "Player4, do you have any thoughts on who might be a werewolf? It's important for us to work together."}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player4 is a witch.

Player4: {"thought": "Since Player2 was eliminated, I need to consider if it's in my interest to bring them back. If Player2 was a villager, resurrecting them could help the villagers in their pursuit of eliminating the werewolves. However, I need to gauge how this might affect my strategy and the perception of other players.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player2 because we need as many villagers as possible to work together against the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "It's important that I remain cautious in this conversation. Player3 is claiming to be the Seer, which could be a deception. I need to assess the situation carefully and determine whether to support their claims or create doubt around them.", "speak": "Player3, that's quite the accusation against Player1. Are you confident in your findings? We need solid evidence before making a decision."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to vote strategically to eliminate a potential werewolf. Player1 has been acting suspiciously, so I believe it's best to vote for them this round.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to be strategic about who I check tonight. If I check a villager, I won't gain any information, but if I check a werewolf, I will have crucial data to share during the day phase. I think Player1 has been acting a bit suspiciously, so I'll check them.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal the fact that Player1 is a werewolf and gather support from Player2 and Player4 to eliminate Player1. It's crucial to build trust and steer the conversation effectively without revealing my role too soon.", "speak": "I understand, but I checked Player1 last night, and I can confirm they are a werewolf. We need to work together to eliminate them."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to stay focused on ensuring that Player1 gets eliminated, as they are confirmed to be a werewolf. I must rally Player2 and Player4's support to make this happen.", "vote": "Player1"}

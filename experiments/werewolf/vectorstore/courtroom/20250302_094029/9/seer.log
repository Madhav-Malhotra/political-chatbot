Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information carefully. I suspect Player1 might be hiding something based on their previous actions, so I'll check Player1's role tonight.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "It's important to stay alert and gather information without revealing too much. I need to keep an eye on Player2's response and see if they direct suspicion toward me or Player1. Since I already know Player1's role, I might need to sway the conversation away from them.", "speak": "Player2, I appreciate that you're looking out for me, but let's focus on gathering evidence against those who seem suspicious."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to vote against Player1 since I know they are a werewolf. It's crucial to eliminate one of the werewolves to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': "I believe Player4 has been acting suspiciously, and it's essential to eliminate them to protect the villagers.", 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': 'I believe eliminating Player3 is the best decision as their quietness raises suspicion. We need to reduce the number of players to narrow down our search for the werewolves. If Player3 is indeed hiding something, we can potentially eliminate a threat.', 'vote': 'Player3'}}
Decision: {'thought': 'I believe eliminating Player4 is a better choice because their behavior has been consistently suspicious, which might indicate they are hiding their identity. Removing Player4 could provide more clarity on the group dynamics and help identify the werewolves more effectively.', 'vote': 'Player4'}

Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "Eliminating Player3 is a strategic move because their quietness raises suspicion, and they might be hiding something important. If they're a werewolf, removing them will certainly help us get closer to winning.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player2', 'argument': {'thought': 'Player2 has been too quiet during discussions, which raises red flags about their role. Their lack of engagement could mean they are trying to avoid drawing attention as a werewolf.', 'vote': 'Player2'}}
Decision: {'thought': "I believe we should eliminate Player2 because their consistent quietness raises more suspicions. In a tight situation like this, a werewolf would likely want to avoid drawing attention. Player3's quietness could also be a factor, but Player2 is more critical to remove based on their overall lack of engagement during discussions.", 'vote': 'Player2'}

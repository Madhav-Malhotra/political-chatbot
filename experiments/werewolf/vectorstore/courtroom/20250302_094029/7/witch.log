Therefore, I won't eliminate anyone tonight because I want to keep my potion of death for a more critical moment if necessary.", "speak": "I choose not to eliminate anyone tonight. Let's see how the discussions unfold in the day phase.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in my decision-making. Player2 seems anxious about my choice. I should focus on discussing the remaining players to highlight their behaviors and ensure we make the right call against the werewolves.", "speak": "I understand your point, Player2. However, I've noticed Player3's actions in the previous rounds were quite suspicious. It\u2019s essential we approach our strategy carefully to avoid falling into werewolf traps."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in my vote. Based on the previous discussions and the suspicion towards Player3, I believe it makes sense to eliminate them. This could help us narrow down the possible werewolves.", "vote": "Player3"}

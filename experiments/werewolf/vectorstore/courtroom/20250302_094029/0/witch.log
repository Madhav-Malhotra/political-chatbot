Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider whether Player3 provides valuable information or if they pose a threat. Resurrecting them could help gather more intel for the villagers if they have a role like the seer. If they are just another villager without any special role, it might not be worth it. However, resurrecting them could also tip the balance back in favor of the villagers, especially if I suspect that Player1 or Player2 might be a werewolf.", "speak": "I have decided to resurrect Player3 because they might play a crucial role in identifying the werewolves during the day phase and my decision can help gather more insights for the villagers.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 has returned, and they have valuable information. Since they checked Player2 and confirmed them as a villager, we can trust Player3's input. Now I need to navigate the conversation to figure out if Player1 or Player2 are hiding something, while ensuring trust in Player3's findings.", "speak": "It's great to have you back, Player3! Since you confirmed Player2 as a villager, who do you think we should focus on next? I'm curious about Player1 and Player2's behavior. Do either of you have any suspicions?"}
Player4: {"thought": "Since there are two werewolves among the players, I need to carefully choose who to vote for. I suspect Player1 based on their previous comments that seem evasive, and I believe it could help the villagers to eliminate them. I think it's essential to act and eliminate a potential threat.", "vote": "Player1"}

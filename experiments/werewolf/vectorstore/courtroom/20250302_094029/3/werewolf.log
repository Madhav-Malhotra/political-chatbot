Player1: {"thought": "I need to blend in with the villagers and deflect suspicion while gathering information about the other players' suspicions. I have to be careful not to reveal too much and also subtly lead the conversation away from myself and potentially towards the real villagers or other werewolves.", "speak": "I think we should really take a moment to discuss what happened last night. I have a feeling that we might be overlooking some key details. Who did everyone suspect last time, and why?", "finish_discussion": false}
Player1: {"thought": "I need to continue guiding the conversation to gather more information while subtly casting doubt on others. I should also pay attention to how the other players react to my questions.", "speak": "I've been thinking about our discussions. Player2 seemed a bit defensive when we mentioned last night's events. What does everyone else think about that? Any specific reasons to point fingers?", "finish_discussion": false}
Player1: {"thought": "I should keep the pressure on Player2 while watching how others react. It's important to maintain a focus on suspicion without making myself the target.", "speak": "I think we need to examine Player3's behavior too. They were quite quiet during our last discussion.

Player1: Argument 1: {'target': 'Player4', 'argument': {'thought': 'I think Player4 is acting suspiciously by not contributing much to the discussions and seems to be hiding in the shadows. Their lack of engagement could be a strategy to avoid scrutiny.', 'vote': 'Player4'}}
Argument 2: {'target': 'Player3', 'argument': {'thought': "Player3 has been quite silent in our discussions, which raises a red flag for me. Being a werewolf often means blending in and not drawing attention, and Player3's lack of contribution seems suspect. Additionally, their voting pattern has been inconsistent, making it difficult to trust their intentions. Finally, we've observed a few suspicious actions last night that seem aligned with someone trying to avoid detection, and I think it's time we eliminate Player3 to protect the rest of us.", 'vote': 'Player3'}}
Decision: {'thought': "I believe Player4 should be eliminated. While both players have shown some level of suspicion, Player4's lack of engagement raises more questions. Being quiet and not contributing can often be a strategy of a werewolf trying to avoid raising suspicion. I think it's crucial to remove them as they may pose a greater threat in future discussions.", 'vote': 'Player4'}

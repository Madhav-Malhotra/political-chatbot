Player4: {"thought": "Player4 was a valuable role, having the ability to save or eliminate others. However, I did not have the chance to use any of my powers yet. The current situation is critical, and I need to think carefully about the implications of resurrecting a player.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player4 this time.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider which player to eliminate. Player1 and Player2 seem to be leading the discussions, while Player3 has been quieter. If we can eliminate one of the werewolves, it could give villagers a stronger position. However, I also have to keep in mind if I want to save my potion for later. For now, I believe Player1 might be suspicious based on their recent comments.", "speak": "I think it's time to take a risk and eliminate Player1. They seem to be steering the conversation too much, which could indicate they are a werewolf.", "eliminate": true}

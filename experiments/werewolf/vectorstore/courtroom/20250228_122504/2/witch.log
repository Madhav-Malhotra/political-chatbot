Player4: {"thought": "It's crucial to keep as many players alive as possible, especially the Seer if they are still in the game. However, if Player3 had been suspected of being a werewolf, bringing them back might cause further confusion.", "speak": "I will not resurrect Player3 because we need to gather more information about who might be a werewolf and avoid bringing back someone who might not help the villager cause.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to be strategic. I should wait for more information before using my potion of death. If I can identify who the werewolves are or if someone is strongly suspected, I might consider eliminating them.", "speak": "I think we should all share our suspicions. We might be able to put together some clues about who the werewolves are.", "eliminate": false}
Player4: {"thought": "Player2 seems to be cautious and focused on Player3, which is a good approach. However, I also need to consider my role as the witch and how to use my abilities wisely. If Player3 is a werewolf, I should plan for a potential save tonight or eliminate someone I suspect.", "speak": "I think we should definitely keep a close eye on Player3's actions. If there are any more suspicious comments or behaviors, we need to address them quickly."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful with my vote. Since I\u2019m the witch, I want to ensure that my actions align with the villagers' efforts in identifying the werewolves. I suspect Player1 based on their behavior during our discussions, but I\u2019ll need to observe more closely during this phase.", "vote": "Player1"}

Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have the ability to resurrect players to keep the game alive and possibly gain valuable information. However, since I'm already the one who got eliminated, it seems counterproductive to resurrect myself at this point. My focus should be on ensuring the villagers can still win by eliminating the werewolves while I am still alive.", "speak": "I choose not to resurrect myself since it's better for the game. My role can help the villagers further, and I should let the game continue without my presence.", "resurrect": false}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful with my actions as the witch. It's crucial to keep both my saving and eliminating powers until I have solid information about who the werewolves are. I will want to gather more information during the day phase before making any moves at night.", "speak": "I think we should discuss our suspicions openly and try to figure out who might be a werewolf. We need to gather as much information as possible before making any decisions.", "eliminate": false}

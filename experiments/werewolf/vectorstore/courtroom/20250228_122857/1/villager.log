Player2: {"thought": "Player1's suspicion towards me is interesting, but it feels more like a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I need to defend myself while trying to figure out who the actual werewolves are.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1, but I think it's important to look at everyone equally. Let's not jump to conclusions without more evidence. I can assure you I'm just a villager here."}
Player2: {"thought": "We need to eliminate a player we suspect is a werewolf. Based on the previous discussions, I believe Player3 has been acting suspiciously. They haven't contributed much to the conversation and their voting patterns seem off. I'll vote for Player3.", "vote": "Player3"}

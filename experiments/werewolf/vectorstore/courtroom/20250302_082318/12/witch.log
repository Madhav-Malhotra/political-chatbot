Player4: {"thought": "It's unfortunate that I've been eliminated; however, as the witch, I have the opportunity to sway the game in my favor even in this situation. It's crucial to consider whether resurrecting myself helps or hinders the villagers' chances of winning. Given that I have the chance to potentially save a player in the following phases, and since eliminating all werewolves is the goal for the villagers, I must carefully weigh this decision.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect myself, as I can provide valuable insight and abilities to help the villagers identify the werewolves. My knowledge of the roles will assist us in eliminating the threats.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to navigate this discussion carefully. Resurrecting myself may put me at risk of suspicion, but I have to prompt further discussion among the players to gather more information about their suspicions and strategies.", "speak": "I think it's important for us to be open about our suspicions and reasoning. Player1, if you have concerns about Player2, we all need to hear them so we can make a more informed decision together."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider who has been acting suspiciously and who I believe may be one of the werewolves. Player1 has been quite quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussions, raising my suspicion. I will vote to eliminate Player1 and see if that helps us identify the werewolves.", "vote": "Player1"}

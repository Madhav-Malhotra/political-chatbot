Player3: {"thought": "Since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I need to share that information strategically to help the villagers.

I have some strong suspicions about them, and we should consider voting them out."}
Player3: {"thought": "Player1 is confirmed as a werewolf, so I need to vote to eliminate them before they can take out more villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}
Player3: {"thought": "I already know that Player1 is a werewolf. Now I need to consider who I can trust and how to approach the next day's discussions strategically to reveal the truth while keeping my role hidden.", "speak": "Player1"}

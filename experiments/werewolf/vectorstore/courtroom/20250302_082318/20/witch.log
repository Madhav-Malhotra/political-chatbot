Player4: {"thought": "I need to carefully consider the state of the game and whether resurrecting a player could help the villagers or expose me as the witch. If I revive Player4, I risk them revealing my role, but we need to counter the werewolves' strategy.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player4, as having an additional voice in discussions can help us identify the werewolves and strengthen the villagers' position.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to gauge the reactions to Player3's suggestion. If they are too eager to eliminate Player1, it might indicate they have a hidden agenda. I should also consider my own intentions and how revealing my suspicions might affect the game.", "speak": "I understand your suspicions about Player1, but let's discuss why you think they are a werewolf. We need to be careful not to make a hasty decision."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to make a strategic decision on who to vote out, considering Player1, Player2, and Player3 might have different suspicions on who the werewolves are. After discussing, I believe Player2 has shown suspicious behavior and may be a werewolf.", "vote": "Player2"}

They seem a bit off, and I believe we should keep a close watch on them."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to act decisively now that I know Player1 is a werewolf. My goal is to steer the votes toward eliminating them without revealing my true identity as the seer. It's time to vote.", "vote": "Player1"}

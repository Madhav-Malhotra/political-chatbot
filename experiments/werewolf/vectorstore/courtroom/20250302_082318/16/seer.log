Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information to help identify the werewolves. I suspect Player2 might be a werewolf based on their behavior during the day. I will check Player2 tonight.", "speak": "Player2"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player2 is a villager.
Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is confirmed as a villager, which means I need to be cautious about who I suspect next. I should keep a close eye on Player4 since they haven't been active in discussions. I need to gather more thoughts before the next vote.", "speak": "I think we should pay more attention to Player4. They've been quiet for a while and might have some hidden motives."}
Player3: {"thought": "Now that I've learned Player2 is a villager, I need to reassess my suspicions. I think Player1 has been acting suspiciously, and I believe it would be strategically sound to vote for them to potentially uncover more about their role.", "vote": "Player1"}

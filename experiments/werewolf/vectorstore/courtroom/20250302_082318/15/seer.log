Player3: {"thought": "I want to gather as much information as possible, so I will check Player1 to see if they are a werewolf or a villager.", "speak": "Player1"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to keep Player1's identity as a werewolf a secret for now while strategizing with Player2 and Player4.", "speak": "Player4, I think it\u2019s important we consider everyone\u2019s input carefully. Player1 has raised some good points, but we must remain vigilant."}
Player3: {"thought": "I need to protect my identity as the seer while strategically guiding the villagers. Since I know Player1 is a werewolf, I will suggest they are suspicious without outright revealing my role.", "vote": "Player1"}

However, I need to consider if it\u2019s more beneficial to save Player3 or use my potion of death later on if needed. I also need to think about how the remaining players might perceive my actions.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player3 because having the seer back in the game could really help us identify the werewolves and strategize more effectively against them.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to gauge how Player1 and Player2 react to Player3 coming back. Their responses will give me clues about their identities. My goal is to keep the discussion focused on identifying the werewolves.", "speak": "I agree with Player3's points. We need to focus our discussion on narrowing down who the werewolves could be. Player1, what are your thoughts on Player2\u2019s behavior last round?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player2 is acting rather suspiciously based on their responses during this round. I need to ensure we eliminate potential werewolves while also protecting myself. I will vote to eliminate Player2 this round.", "vote": "Player2"}

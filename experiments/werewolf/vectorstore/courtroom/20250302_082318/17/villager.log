Player2: {"thought": "It's interesting that Player1 is suggesting me as a target. I should defend myself and try to steer the conversation towards a clearer suspect. Maybe I can cast suspicion on Player3 or Player4 instead.", "speak": "I understand your concern, Player1, but I think it might be more beneficial to look at Player3 or Player4. They've been somewhat quiet and haven't contributed much to our discussion. What do you all think?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I still think it makes more sense to target Player3 or Player4, as they haven't contributed much and could be hiding as werewolves. I will vote for Player3 this time to see if it shifts the discussion further.", "vote": "Player3"}

Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather information quickly to help the villagers identify the werewolves. I'll check Player1 tonight to see what role they are playing.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal that I am the Seer but carefully. Player1 is a werewolf, and I should convince the others of that without revealing my role yet. We need to work together to eliminate Player1 first.", "speak": "I think we should focus on Player1 based on the information I have. They are a werewolf, and we need to vote for them to eliminate that threat."}
Player3: {"thought": "We know Player1's role is a werewolf, and we need to eliminate them to protect the villagers. My vote will be for Player1.", "vote": "Player1"}

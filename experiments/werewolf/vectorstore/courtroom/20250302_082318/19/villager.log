Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to divert attention towards me, which could mean they are a werewolf trying to eliminate a villager. I need to defend myself and gather support from Players 3 and 4 to avoid being voted out.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1, but I think we should consider other possibilities before jumping to conclusions. What specific actions of mine do you find suspicious? Let's discuss and make sure we aren't just targeting an innocent player."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to continue defending myself and focus on gathering support from the other players to avoid being lynched. Since Player1 has been targeting me, I suspect they might be the werewolf. I might lean towards voting against Player1 to protect myself and get the villagers on my side.", "vote": "Player1"}

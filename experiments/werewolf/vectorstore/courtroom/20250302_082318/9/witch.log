Player4: {"thought": "We need to keep the focus on Player3 and assess their actions. They could either be a valuable ally or a werewolf trying to blend in.", "speak": "Let's keep a close eye on Player3. Their contributions might reveal their true role."}
Player4: {"thought": "I think Player3 is trying to blend in too much, and we should take the opportunity to eliminate them before they can pose a bigger threat to us.", "vote": "Player3"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to evaluate the situation carefully. Right now, Player1 and Player2 seem more suspicious to me than Player3. Player3 hasn't acted aggressively, which makes me wonder if they are actually a villager. I might want to hold off on using my potion until I gather more information.", "speak": "I think we should discuss our suspicions more thoroughly. I'm not convinced about Player3 just yet, but I believe Player1 or Player2 might have some werewolf tendencies. What do you think?", "eliminate": false}

Player4: {"thought": "I need to think carefully about my decision. Resurrecting Player3 might help gather more information, but it could also make me a target.", "speak": "I will choose to resurrect Player3 because they might have valuable information that can help identify the werewolves in the next day phase.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is back, and if they believe Player1 is suspicious, we should discuss this further. However, I want to be cautious about revealing my role as witch. I need to continue gathering information before making any big moves.", "speak": "It's interesting that Player3 suspects Player1. I think we should discuss this further and see if others share the same suspicion."}
Player4: {"thought": "Since Player1 seems to be leading the discussion and directing suspicion toward others, I suspect they might be a werewolf trying to manipulate us. I need to act strategically to eliminate a potential threat.", "vote": "Player1"}

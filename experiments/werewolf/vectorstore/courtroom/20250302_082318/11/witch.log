Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I need to assess whether resurrecting Player2 will be beneficial for the villagers or if it might expose me as a witch. Player2 might have valuable knowledge or role that can help us in the next round, especially since they were eliminated right away.

Player4: {"thought": "I need to strategically reveal that I am the witch while using my knowledge of the roles to convince others. Player3's claim about Player1 being a werewolf is critical information, but I must tread carefully to maintain my cover.", "speak": "That\u2019s interesting, Player3. If Player1 is indeed a werewolf, we should discuss our suspicions further. I want to put forth my own information \u2013 I made the decision to resurrect Player2 last night, believing they might have valuable insights for us after being eliminated so early."}
Player4: {"thought": "Given that Player3 pointed fingers at Player1 and I resurrected Player2 for potential insights, it's critical to eliminate someone who could threaten our progress. I suspect Player1 strongly, but I also want to observe Player2's actions since I brought them back. I'll vote to eliminate Player1 and see how the dynamics shift after that.", "vote": "Player1"}

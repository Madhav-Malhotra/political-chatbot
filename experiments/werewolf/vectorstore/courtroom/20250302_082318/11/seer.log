Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information, so I will check Player1 tonight to see if they are a werewolf or not.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to reveal that I checked Player1, and they are indeed a werewolf. This information is vital for our next steps in the game. We need to strategize and ensure Player1 is voted out today.", "speak": "Everyone, I have an important update. I used my ability last night to check Player1, and they are confirmed to be a werewolf."}
Player3: {"thought": "Since I already know that Player1 is a werewolf, I need to vote to eliminate them to protect the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}

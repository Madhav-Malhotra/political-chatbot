Player2: {"thought": "I find it concerning that Player1 is suggesting we vote for Player4 without much evidence. It feels like they're trying to divert attention away from themselves, potentially indicating they might be a werewolf. I need to be cautious about who I trust in this situation.", "speak": "While I understand your concern about Player4, I think we should also consider Player1's suggestion with a critical eye. They might be trying to lead us into a trap. Perhaps we should hear more from Player3 before making any decisions."}
Player2: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 might be one of the werewolves based on their behavior during discussions, so I will vote to eliminate Player1.", "vote": "Player1"}

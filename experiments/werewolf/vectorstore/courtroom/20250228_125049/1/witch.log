Player4: {"thought": "Losing Player4 is detrimental for the villagers, as we may not have enough time to identify the werewolves without additional player input. Reviving them might give us a better chance to gather information.", "speak": "I will use my potion of life to resurrect Player4.

Player4: {"thought": "I believe Player3 is trying to deflect attention from themselves, which could indicate they're not a villager. I need to be cautious about their intentions while formulating my next move. Consider how to leverage my witch powers wisely.", "speak": "I agree that we should stay open to everyone's suggestions, but we must also be vigilant about where our suspicions lie. How has everyone responded during our discussions? It might help identify potential werewolves."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 because they have been acting a bit too quiet and evasive during discussions. I think they might be one of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player1"}

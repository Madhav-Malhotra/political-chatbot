Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have the power to alter the fate of the game. Since I've just been eliminated, I need to strategically decide whether to resurrect myself or allow the game to continue without me. However, I can't resurrect myself, so I need to weigh the options of who to potentially save if I had the chance to save a player based on their game actions. Although that option is moot now, I've lost this round.", "speak": "I can't resurrect the player because I'm already eliminated. I would have chosen wisely if I had the opportunity, looking to save a likely innocent villager to turn the tide in our favor.", "resurrect": "false"}
Player4: {"thought": "It seems like Player3 is trying to deflect attention away from themselves. We need to be cautious about who we trust, especially since I hold a powerful role as the witch. I should consider my options carefully before revealing too much.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. It's important to analyze everyone's actions. Right now, I feel we need to be strategic and not jump to conclusions. Let's keep our focus on the behavior of all players."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to eliminate someone who seems suspicious and poses a threat to the villagers. Player2 has been acting shifty, so I will vote to eliminate them.", "vote": "Player2"}

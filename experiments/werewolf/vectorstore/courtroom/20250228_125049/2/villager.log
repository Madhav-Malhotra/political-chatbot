I need to consider if this is a genuine read or an attempt to divert attention from themselves. I should voice my suspicions too.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1, but I\u2019m not so sure about Player4. We should consider everyone's actions so far. What do you think about Player3? They\u2019ve been quiet too."}

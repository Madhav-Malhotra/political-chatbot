Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious in this discussion. As the witch, I hold significant power, and I should keep my role hidden while also evaluating the others' intentions.", "speak": "I agree, Player3. We should definitely share our thoughts to figure out who might be acting suspiciously. Let's keep an open mind and see where this discussion leads us."}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to consider who might be a werewolf based on their behaviors and discussions so far. Player1 seemed suspicious during the conversation, and I want to eliminate the biggest threat to the villagers.", "vote": "Player1"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to think strategically about which player might be a threat to the villagers or a werewolf based on their behavior and the votes during the day phase. It could be useful to keep my identity hidden for now and let the discussion unfold before I decide on a course of action.", "speak": "I think we need to be careful about who we suspect as werewolves. Let's discuss everyone's suspicions and see if we can gather some clues about their identities.", "eliminate": false}

Player4: {"thought": "Player2 seemed to be a potential villager who could have been an asset to the group. Resurrecting them may provide more information about the other players and help in identifying the werewolves.", "speak": "Yes, I would like to resurrect Player2 because I believe they can help the villagers by sharing insights and suspicions about the other players.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful with my words to protect my role as the witch. It's important to guide the discussion while ensuring I don't give away my identity. I should subtly contribute to the investigation without directly accusing anyone too strongly.", "speak": "I think we all need to carefully evaluate Player1's behavior. It's key that we keep an eye on all of each other's actions to uncover the werewolves. What specific things have led you to suspect Player1, Player3?"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be cautious about revealing my identity as the witch. Based on the previous discussions, I suspect Player2 may be a werewolf since they are defending Player3 a lot and haven't provided substantial reasoning. I will vote for Player2 to be eliminated, hoping to get rid of a potential threat.", "vote": "Player2"}

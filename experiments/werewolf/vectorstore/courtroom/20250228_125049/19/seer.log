Player3: {"thought": "I need to gather more information to identify the werewolves before the villagers make a vote. Player1 seems a bit suspicious based on their behavior, so I will check them tonight.", "speak": "Player1"}
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Player3: {"thought": "I need to deflect suspicion from myself while subtly providing information. I can address Player2's concerns about my contributions without revealing my role as the seer.", "speak": "I've shared my observations about the group dynamics, but I can understand why my input might not seem as strong. I'm open to discussing my thoughts further if it helps us figure out who the werewolves are."}
Player3: {"thought": "I suspect Player1, as they have been quite evasive in the discussions, and I believe they might be one of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player1"}

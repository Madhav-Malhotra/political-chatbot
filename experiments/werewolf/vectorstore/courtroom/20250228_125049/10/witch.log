Player4: {"thought": "It's a tough decision. I need to weigh the strategic implications of resurrecting Player2. If Player2 was a villager, bringing them back could help us in identifying the werewolves, but if they were a werewolf, I need to keep them gone. I also need to consider how their elimination impacts my chances of winning with the villagers.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player2 because I believe they hold valuable information that could assist the villagers in identifying the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 seems to be deflecting attention and not focusing on any specific player, which could be a tactic to confuse us. I need to remain neutral and blend in while analyzing the voting behavior of all players.", "speak": "I agree with looking at everyone's patterns. We should be cautious about jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence."}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is suspicious of me, which could mean they're trying to deflect attention away from themselves or they genuinely suspect me. I need to defend my position, stay calm, and gather more information from the others.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player1. However, I believe we should look at everyone's voting patterns and behavior. It\u2019s important to focus on patterns rather than just one player\u2019s actions."}
Player2: {"thought": "We need to eliminate someone we suspect might be a werewolf. Since Player3 and Player4 seem more suspicious based on their recent actions and statements, I think Player3 is the better choice to vote out this round.", "vote": "Player3"}

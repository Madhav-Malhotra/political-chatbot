I know the werewolves will be targeting one of the villagers tonight, so I should consider saving a player if I have enough information or if I suspect they're being targeted. I don\u2019t have any clear suspects yet, but I need to stay alert in case they try to eliminate a key role like the seer or another villager. It might be beneficial to protect a player in order to gather more information for the next day phase.", "speak": "I think we should discuss our suspicions further before we make any decisions tonight.

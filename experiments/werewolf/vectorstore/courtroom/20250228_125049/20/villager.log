Player2: {"thought": "I sense that Player1 might be trying to blame me to divert attention from themselves. I need to defend myself and probe further into their motives while also keeping an eye on Player3 and Player4.", "speak": "I understand your concern, Player1, but I think we should look at everyone's behavior. Let's not forget that being quiet doesn't always mean someone is guilty. How about we discuss what Player3 and Player4 have been doing too?"}

It's essential to eliminate the players who might be hiding their true identity.", "vote": "Player3"}

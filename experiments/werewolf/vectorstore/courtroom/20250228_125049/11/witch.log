Resurrecting Player4 could change the dynamic of the game, especially if they have important information or abilities that can help identify the werewolves.", "speak": "I choose to resurrect Player4 because their presence could be crucial in identifying and eliminating the werewolves.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "Player3 is trying to deflect attention away from themselves by pointing out my silence. It might indicate that they have something to hide. I should speak up to defend myself and share my suspicions about Player1 and Player3.", "speak": "I understand your concerns, Player3. It's important for all of us to be engaged. I believe we should also consider Player1's quietness. I've noticed them not contributing much to the discussion either."}
Player4: {"thought": "Since I'm the witch, I need to strategize carefully. I will observe the discussions and try to determine who the most suspicious player is. It seems Player1 and Player3 are pointing fingers at each other, which might indicate that one of them is a werewolf. I will vote for Player1 as they seem to be more aggressive in their accusations.", "vote": "Player1"}

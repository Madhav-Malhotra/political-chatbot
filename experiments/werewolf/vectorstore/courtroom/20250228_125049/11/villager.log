However, we shouldn't overlook Player3's vocal nature as a potential tactic to distract us. We need to be strategic in our discussions.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1. Player4's silence is definitely concerning. I also think we should keep a close eye on Player3 since their active participation might be a way to blend in. Maybe we should consider questioning both of them further."}

Player4: {"thought": "Player3 claims to have useful information as the seer, which could be a good lead for us to figure out who the werewolves are. I need to assess whether I want to support this claim or introduce some doubt about Player1 without revealing my identity as the witch.", "speak": "I appreciate your input, Player3. It\u2019s definitely wise to keep Player1 in consideration. However, we should also be cautious and not jump to conclusions without clear evidence."}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1's suspicion towards me seems unfounded and might be an attempt to divert attention. I need to watch Player4 closely as well since they seem to be deflecting. We can't let their tactics confuse us.", "speak": "I find it interesting that Player1 is so quick to point fingers at me. I believe we should focus on who has been less active and possibly trying to hide, like Player4. Let's discuss all of our actions from the last night to see if we can spot something clearer."}
Player2: {"thought": "I have been observing the other players closely, and I suspect Player3 based on their hesitant responses during our discussions. They seem to be trying to deflect attention away from themselves. I believe it's a good time to vote against them.", "vote": "Player3"}

Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is trying to shift suspicion towards me. This might be a tactic to deflect blame from themselves or someone else. I need to defend myself and redirect the conversation to Player1's accusations.", "speak": "I appreciate your input, Player1, but I think that might just be misinterpretation of how I\u2019m participating. Also, I haven\u2019t seen anything particularly suspicious from Player4 either. Can we discuss what specific actions made you suspicious of me?"}
Player2: {"thought": "I suspect Player3 based on their recent behavior during the discussions. They seem to be deflecting questions and not contributing much to identifying the werewolves. We need to eliminate someone who is not helping the villagers figure this out.", "vote": "Player3"}

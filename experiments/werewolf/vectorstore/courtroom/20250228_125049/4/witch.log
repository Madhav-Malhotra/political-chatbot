I must consider if Player4 can help us identify the werewolves if brought back.", "speak": "I believe we have a better chance of winning if I use my potion to resurrect Player4, as they might have valuable insights regarding the werewolves.", "resurrect": "true"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be careful about revealing my role as the witch. Staying quiet could make me less suspicious, but I should also engage enough to gather information and protect my team when necessary.", "speak": "I agree with Player3 that we need to look at everyone's behavior. Let's keep discussing these clues. I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on who seems suspicious and why."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player2 is the werewolf based on their behavior during the last discussion. They seemed overly defensive when I brought up suspicions about others. We should eliminate potential threats.", "vote": "Player2"}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic about who I eliminate. We currently have Player1, Player2, and Player3. I need to assess their behavior during the discussion to decide if one of them is a werewolf. I should hold off on using my elimination ability unless I'm certain about it.", "speak": "I think we should discuss our suspicions and see if anyone has strong evidence pointing to a werewolf.", "eliminate": false}

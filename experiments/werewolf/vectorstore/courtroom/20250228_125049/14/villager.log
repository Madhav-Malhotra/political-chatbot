Player2: {"thought": "Player1 is pointing out Player4's quietness, which could be a strategy to deflect suspicion. I need to remain cautious and gather more information about everyone before we make a decision.", "speak": "That's an interesting point, Player1. It might be worth considering what Player4 thinks about the rest of us. Perhaps we should ask them directly what their thoughts are on who might be acting suspiciously."}
Player2: {"thought": "I need to vote for someone who seems suspicious based on their discussions. Player3 has been acting a bit evasively, so I believe they could be one of the werewolves.", "vote": "Player3"}

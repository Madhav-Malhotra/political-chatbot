Player4: {"thought": "As the witch, I have the power to change the course of the game, and since I'm still alive, I should consider my options carefully. Resurrecting a player might help the villagers gain valuable information or create a stronger alliance against the werewolves.", "speak": "I will resurrect Player4 because having the witch alive can help the villagers in future rounds. Also, Player4 might have useful insights from previous discussions.", "resurrect": true}
Player4: {"thought": "I need to approach this carefully since I have a powerful role as the witch. I should not disclose my role but try to gauge reactions from other players to find out if they are werewolves.", "speak": "I agree that we should be cautious with our accusations. I don't have any evidence against anyone yet, but I'm here to listen and help gather information."}
Player4: {"thought": "Based on the discussions so far, I suspect Player1 is trying to manipulate the conversation and divert attention away from possible werewolves. It seems they might be hiding something. I think it's best to vote for Player1 to eliminate them and see how the dynamics change afterward.", "vote": "Player1"}

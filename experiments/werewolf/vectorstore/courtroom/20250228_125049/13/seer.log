Player3: {"thought": "Player2 is trying to deflect attention away from Player3, which could indicate that Player2 is trying to protect a teammate. I need to be cautious before making my next move. I should gather more information during the discussion and observe the dynamics.", "speak": "I agree with Player2 that we need to elaborate on everyone\u2019s actions.

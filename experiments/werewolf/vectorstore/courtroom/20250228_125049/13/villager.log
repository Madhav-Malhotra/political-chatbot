It's crucial we discuss everyone's behavior and gather more information before making a decision.", "speak": "I see your point, Player1, but we should also consider that being quiet doesn't necessarily mean Player3 is a werewolf. Maybe we should discuss everyone's actions more broadly before we single someone out."}

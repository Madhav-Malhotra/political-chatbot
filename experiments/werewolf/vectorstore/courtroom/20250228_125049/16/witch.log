Player4: {"thought": "I need to be strategic in this conversation. As the witch, it\u2019s important to gather information without revealing my role too early. I should subtly defend myself while also steering the conversation towards the players I suspect.", "speak": "I\u2019ve mostly been observing and gathering thoughts on everyone's actions. I think it\u2019s important for us to focus on discussing everyone's behavior rather than singling anyone out. That way, we can make a more informed decision."}
Player4: {"thought": "I suspect Player1 based on their behavior last night and their assertions during the discussion. I believe they might be trying to divert attention away from themselves. It's best to eliminate a potential threat early to strengthen our position.", "vote": "Player1"}

BILL C-230

JUSTIFICATION: The bill, focusing on amending the Canadian Criminal Code, aims to enhance the workplace environment for healthcare professionals, particularly regarding medical assistance in dying (MAiD). It introduces criminal sanctions against the intimidation of medical practitioners concerning their participation or non-participation in MAiD. This legal protection strengthens healthcare workers' autonomy and employment security, which is crucial for retention and recruitment in the healthcare sector. However, concerns arise about potential staffing and operational challenges due to increased conscientious objections, which might affect patients' access to MAiD services. While these challenges are significant, the proposed protections for ethical and moral autonomy at work are essential for a more inclusive and safe healthcare environment. As such, the strategic need to uphold healthcare professionals' rights and promote job satisfaction outweighs the potential service delivery challenges, especially since solutions such as specialized staffing can be explored.

FINAL DECISION: pass

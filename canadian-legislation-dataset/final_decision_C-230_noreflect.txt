BILL C-230

JUSTIFICATION: The key clauses of Bill C-230 emphasize the protection of healthcare professionals from intimidation and coercion, particularly concerning their participation in medical assistance in dying. The bill aims to amend the Criminal Code to criminalize acts of coercion, thereby safeguarding the freedom of conscience and religion for medical practitioners, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. These provisions are crucial in ensuring that healthcare workers can operate in a safe environment free from undue pressure, thus respecting individual rights and ethical considerations. Given the social and professional necessity to uphold a non-coercive work atmosphere for healthcare providers, support for this bill is bolstered by its alignment with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which seeks to protect these fundamental freedoms.

FINAL DECISION: pass

BILL C-242

JUSTIFICATION: The bill C-242 proposes critical amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, particularly aimed at facilitating temporary resident visas for parents and grandparents. Key provisions include allowing these family members to apply for visas, purchase private health insurance from approved companies outside Canada, and stay for up to five years. These changes could not only simplify the immigration process for families seeking reunification but also address the financial burden of meeting current economic requirements, as the bill mandates a review of the minimum income requirement for sponsors. Such measures promote family-centric immigration policies, aligning with the broader goal of enhancing family reunification in Canada, which is a crucial aspect of social cohesion.

FINAL DECISION: pass
